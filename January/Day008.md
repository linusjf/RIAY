### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 08 - "OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN" Michelle Jackson

\*God is Good, all the time, and all the Time, God is Good!! How God Loves us is so precious, and that truth needs to take root in us, i love that when Jesus' disciples asked Him how to pray He said; say "OUR FATHER!!" that relationship He extends to us is unfathomable. He wants us to know That He is our Father and Jesus came to reveal that to us, to restore that relationship that was broken in the beginning. He wants us to approach Our Father as little children who don't need to use big words or our language to be perfect but simply, us being like Children who are learning to talk. But with great reverence and adoration. God understands our hearts more than we ever know or the words we want to speak even before we say it. Thank you Yeshua for teaching us to pray and Thank you Abba Father for allowing us to call You "OUR FATHER".\*üôèüèΩ

### AI-Generated Summary: Approaching God as Father

This episode initiates the "Biblical Roots of the Rosary" series, focusing on the Our Father. Specifically, it examines "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name" through the lens of Genesis 32:13, where Jacob attempts to appease his brother Esau with lavish gifts out of fear. This narrative serves as a counterpoint to the prayer's message.

The key takeaway is that prayer should not be driven by fear or a desire to appease God like Jacob did with Esau. Instead, we should approach God with the reverence due a loving father and the confidence of a beloved child. The speaker uses the analogy of his relationship with his own father, highlighting the difference between formal respect and the easy familiarity of a son. This emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's power while simultaneously approaching Him with simple humility and trust.

The episode encourages listeners to reflect on their own prayer life, asking: Do you approach God as a loving father or as someone to be feared and appeased? It prompts introspection and a desire to purify one's approach to prayer.

The episode includes the recitation of the Our Father, three Hail Marys, and the Glory Be, reinforcing the practical application of the discussed principles. The core message is a call to cultivate a childlike trust and intimacy with God in prayer.
