### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 12 - "DELIVER US FROM EVIL" Michelle Jackson

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. The Lord is the Good shepherd who leads His flock, who delivers and protects His flock. He goes in search of His sheep and He lays down His life for His sheep, Such is our GodüôåüèºOur God is our deliverer and our only protection. These words in the "our Father" are given by the Father through Jesus to us. He wants us to "TRUST" Him and to know that He alone is the one who can and will save us. We need to meditate and ponder each line in that prayer that reveals the heart of the Father. We need to remind ourselves and renew our thinking each time we are tempted to stress and worry about situations in our lives that are beyond our control. Because Jesus came as the Good shepherd to provide, protect, defend, deliver and save us and that He died for us so that we may live. Thank you Abba Father for the gift of Thyself through Jesus in the HolySpirit.üôèüèΩ
