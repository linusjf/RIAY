### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 18 - "OUR SWEETNESS, OUR HOPE" Michelle Jackson

"Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our Sweetness and our Hope", what a beautiful way to put that Father Mark😇, as Jesus provided food for our journey to Eternal life, which is bread( Himself) when He instituted the Holy Eucharist and the wine His blood, which is sweet, and wine that is used to celebrate Joys in life, He adds that sweetness to our lives by giving us His Mother to be our Mother, and she truly gives us Joy when we go through her to Him. The warmth and love of a Mother He gave us all . The Mother of all Mothers. Thank you Yeshua for the gift Thy Mother. You did not hold back anything from us. You gave us Yourself fully, and also your Mother. How much our God loves us. Thank you for being our Mother Mamma Mary 🙏🏻
