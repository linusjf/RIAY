### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 11 - "AS WE FORGIVE" Michelle Jackson

"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us". That truly isn't something we can do by ourselves. We need Grace. God is calling us to share in His Divinity through the Grace we receive through the HolySpirit in Jesus. We are called to do as He does and that comes with a cost, we need to become selfless and die to ourselves to become like Jesus. He took the hardest part the one that got Him killed for us so that we could gain merit through all He did for us. We need Grace and every day we need to seek that from Him. The more we allow ourselves to see and be reminded of the suffering Christ through meditation on His crucifixion the more it should make us aware of what He did for us on the cross. When He said Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. He begged God's Mercy on us, and as baptized Christians we are you all called to do that. Forgive as we are forgiven. We are all accountable to God for our actions. Let us remember the highest gift of His love and Mercy through Jesus Christ. üôèüèª
