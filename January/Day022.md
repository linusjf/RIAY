### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 22 - "LEAD SOULS TO HEAVEN" Michelle Jackson

That was an intense journey with Father Mike,on our own salvation and the salvation of our loved ones. God is Love and He desires Salvation of the whole World. More than we desire the salvation of our loved ones God is already pursuing us.\* _And for those gone astray, the Good shepherd goes in search, not wanting to lose even one. He searches and brings us back to His flock._ _He reveals His heart to those who respond and co-operate with His Will for mankind. He did reveal this to our blessed Mother of when she appeared to the 3 visionaries, to pray many Rosaries for poor sinners and taught them to pray a special prayer after every decade. So precious._ _Our life is precious, bought by the Blood Of The Lamb and we need to take that seriously asking grace to reflect on our life and our living. Does it please God?_ _Do we please Him or the World?Do we know our Worth?_
_When we die we either will go to heaven or hell._ \*How we live here, what we do now matters. Let us not be afraid but Trust God. We are Christians.and Christians are people of Hope. The Hope that comes from God Himself. Thank you Lord for Your Saving Grace and Your Love for us all. May the whole world respond to that grace and co-operate and desire our own salvation and the salvation of the whole world. May the whole world be Sanctified Sanctified and purified. Amen.
