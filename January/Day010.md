### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 10 - " DAILY BREAD" Michelle Jackson

Give us this day our daily bread. Jesus wants us to trust Him and asks us not to be anxious about the next day. He tells us we are of more value than the birds of the air and that as He provides for them who neither sow nor reap nor gather them into the barns yet He provides for them. Our God is Jehovah Jireh - "The God who provides" God Himself is our portion. Jesus came so that we may have life in abundance and He wants us to trust Him. We need to persevere in Joy and Faith and go to Him daily in prayer and communion. This bread is the sharing of His own divine life. This grace we receive flows generously from Him but we need to come to Him and receive that daily. Like the Israelites who had to collect their daily bread we too christians have to do the same through prayer. We get to receive Him in the Sacraments the Holy Eucharist which is real bread, Himself! to live the Life He's offering to us. Thank you Jesus for this life giving food you give to us all.

### AI-Generated Summary: Daily Bread Daily Grace

This theological reflection centers on the petition "Give us this day our daily bread," focusing intently on the word "daily."

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **The Manna Narrative (Exodus 16):**

This Old Testament story serves as a foundational illustration. God provided manna to the Israelites in the desert, instructing them to gather only enough for one day. This demonstrated God's reliable, day-by-day provision and taught dependence on Him, showing that everyone received exactly what they needed for that specific day. This event prefigures Jesus.

1. **Jesus' Teaching on Anxiety (Matthew 6):**

The reflection connects the manna story to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, specifically His command not to be anxious about future needs (like food or drink), pointing to God's care for creation (e.g., birds). 3. **Grace as Spiritual "Daily Bread":**

For Christians, the "daily bread" is interpreted primarily as internal, spiritual nourishment – God's grace. This grace, encompassing faith, hope, and charity, is a share in God's divine life. 4. **The Role of Daily Prayer:**

Accessing this daily grace requires active participation. Personal prayer each day is presented as the means by which individuals approach God to receive the necessary spiritual sustenance.

**Key Takeaways:**

**\*Focus on the Present:**

The core message is to trust God for _today's_ needs and challenges, rather than worrying about the future. God provides what is necessary _for this day._

**Sufficiency of Grace:** God's grace is abundant and sufficient for the present moment's demands – enabling perseverance, carrying one's cross, and living generously and joyfully \*today\*. It's not necessarily stockpiled for future use.

**Active Reception:** Like the Israelites gathering manna daily, Christians must actively seek and receive God's grace each day through personal prayer.

**Jesus as Provision:** Ultimately, Jesus Himself is our "daily bread," the source of the grace needed for the spiritual journey. Trust is placed in God Himself, who is always present.

**Notable Insights:**
The manna story insight: "those who gathered a lot had no excess, and those who gathered little had no lack" highlights the precise sufficiency of God's daily provision.\_ The shift from external manna to internal grace marks the fulfillment found in Christ.

Anxiety about the future is countered by understanding that God provides specifically for \*today\*, requiring a daily return to Him. In essence, the message encourages a life lived in daily dependence on God, accessed through prayer, trusting that He provides the necessary spiritual strength (grace) to navigate each day's challenges and live faithfully in the present moment.
