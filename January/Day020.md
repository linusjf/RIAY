### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 20 - "Eyes of Mercy" Michelle Jackson

So beautifully put Father Mark. The Lord who understands the poverty of man and all He has to give, He accepts with love. The Holy Family poor as they were, offering what they could afford was pleasing to God. God understands and accepts all we give Him, as He understood the condition of the poor widow who offered all she had and put into the treasury. Comparing her to our blessed Mother was looking at it through humble eyes. Mamma Mary too accepts all we give to her even if it isn't the best we can or imperfect as it can be, she accepts it with love from her little children. Let us pray to desire to give our best to her. It's so comforting to know that even if we couldn't do our best in offering our prayers it's the heart she sees. Thank you Mamma Mary
