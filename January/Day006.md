(Defeats him).We need grace and God's armor of protection when we pray, we need to ask our Holy Angels to pray with us and keep watch over us when we begin to pray. Prayer changes everything if we allow it to change us, we need to trust and surrender to God when we pray. Prayer is the health of our soul and living on this earth. We need to cooperate with the Holy Spirit when we pray, we pray and need to listen as well, prayer truly wages war on the inside cause we are weak and vulnerable but we need to defeat that by using the Word of God at all times. st. Alphonsus' says "Those who pray are certainly saved, those who do not are damned, !! so deep. May the HolySpirit reawaken in us. Amen\*
