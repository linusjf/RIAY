### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 6 - PRAYER IS A BATTLE - Michelle Jackson

Prayer is a weapon to disarm the evil one, the very thoughts he tempts us with especially when we begin to pray shows clear signs he's always around. As 1 Peter 5:8 says -Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. And Ephesians 6: 11&12 says , put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil, for we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies but against the principalities against powers against the world rulers of this present darkness , against the spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places. (Defeats him).We need grace and God's armor of protection when we pray, we need to ask our Holy Angels to pray with us and keep watch over us when we begin to pray. Prayer changes everything if we allow it to change us, we need to trust and surrender to God when we pray. Prayer is the health of our soul and living on this earth. We need to cooperate with the Holy Spirit when we pray, we pray and need to listen as well, prayer truly wages war on the inside cause we are weak and vulnerable but we need to defeat that by using the Word of God at all times. st. Alphonsus' says "Those who pray are certainly saved, those who do not are damned, !! so deep. May the HolySpirit reawaken in us. Amen\*
