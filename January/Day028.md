### AI-Generated Summary: On Believing You Are Forgiven

We profess belief in the great articles of our faith, among them the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. But it is one thing to assent to these truths with the mind, and quite another to live as if they were indeed true. As scripture reminds us, a faith that does not manifest itself in works is, in a sense, dead. What, then, might be a work demonstrating a living faith in the forgiveness of sins? Perhaps it is simply this: to stand upright, to smile, to be joyful, and to walk in freedom.

Consider the parable of the Prodigal Son. The father, seeing his lost boy return, runs to him, embraces him, and throws a feast. The son, laden with the heavy bag of his wasted life and sins, is met with utter, complete forgiveness. The father takes the bag, destroys it, and cancels the debt.

Here is the curious paradox: we are like the son at the feast, forgiven, embraced, the burden lifted. Yet, too often, we stand there bent over, our hands still cupped as if carrying the weight that is no longer there. We have received the forgiveness, but we have not yet truly _believed_ it in our bones.

What does it mean, then, to believe in the forgiveness of sins?

- It means recognising that when God forgives, He forgives utterly. The debt is paid, the bag is gone.
- It means refusing to carry the 'fake weight' of remembered sins that God Himself has cast away. This lingering burden prevents joy and freedom.
- It means, for any sin yet unconfessed or unrepented, taking it honestly to God, perhaps through the Church's appointed means, so that it too may be truly gone.
- It means accepting the freedom that Christ has purchased for us, standing tall in His mercy, and allowing the reality of our cleansing to produce genuine joy.

To believe in forgiveness is not merely to say the words, but to live as one who is, in truth, forgiven â€“ released from the weight, free to rejoice in the Father's house. Let us pray that we may learn this blessed posture.
