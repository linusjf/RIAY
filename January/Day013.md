### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 13 - "FULL OF GRACE" Michelle Jackson

"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee." This greeting given by God to the Angel Gabriel is whole. Mission plan revealed. This greeting  is not by the angel but is God's greeting. It's what Mamma Mary is and who He created her to be. It is at this moment He reveals His mission plan to her . The Lord is with thee, these words are so beautiful to ponder on. As in the "Our Father" we are taught how to approach  God and in the "Hail Mary" we are taught how to approach Mamma Mary.  We Honour Jesus when we honour Mamma Mary. Truly no one can love her as much as Jesus did. He gave His Mother to us and we need to thank Him for that.  This prayer, this salutation was a revelation for and to her for the whole world and she said "Yes", let us too ask God what is His mission for us. For surely The Lord is with us always. üôèüèΩHail Mary full of graceüåπ
