### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 17 - "Turn on the Light" Michelle Jackson

"IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLYSPIRIT - THE SIGN OF THE CROSS"
*The mystery of the most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian Faith and life , it is the mystery of God Himself. It also is the source of all other* *mysteries of Faith, the Light that enlightens them.* \*Truly one needs Faith to understand that. We need to ask the HolySpirit for grace to See which God gives us through Baptism all through our lives. And when we make the sign of the cross we are opening our eyes to see Him, to see all of creation and all other mysteries in His light. Jesus Christ is the Light of the World and we need His light to guide us through, there are many other lights in this world to lead us astray, so to know and see the difference we need to understand the path we are taking if it leads us to Him or away from Him. May Christ' light be our light always. Jesus said whoever follows me shall never walk in darkness. *Hebrew 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would approach God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.*

Romans 10:17- So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.
