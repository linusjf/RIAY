### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 21b- "Show unto us" Michelle Jackson

"And after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement,O loving O sweet Virgin Mary." Mother's know what to do, I love how Fr. Mike said our Lady understands us, she experiences our pain and our need and our sufferings and takes us to Jesus, as at the wedding at Cana ,when they had run out of wine, She told Jesus about the situation and when He said His time hadn't come yet She told  the servants there to "do whatever He tells you". And Jesus did His first miracle. He obeyed His mamma, and so too for us she takes us to Jesus bringing us into a relationship with Him and tells us to do the same. Listen to Him, do what He tells you. Such a beautiful way of communication we are taught. And that's  what prayer should be like. It should be that conversation. Let us ask for grace to speak and make known our requests and listen to what Jesus tells us to do...
