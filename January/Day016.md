### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 16 - "GLORIFY HIM" Michelle Jackson

"Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning,is now and ever shall be world without end.Amen". All Praise and Glory be to the Holy Trinity. What is Praise? It is a form of prayer which recognises that God is God. It is right that we praise Him. It is to look to Him always, cause it is the right thing to do. It is for our own Good to Praise God, not for what he does but for who He is. He the maker of all things must be acknowledged by all, and Praised and Glorified by all. God is pleased when we do so not because He needs it,But because its right. When you Love Him and see how Faithful God is in your life you will begin to Praise Him. Cause everyday we are alive and its cause He wills it for us and we take that for granted. Let us Thank Him Throughout the day by asking for that grace
_Psalms 34:1- I will bless the LORD at all times : His praise shall continually be in my mouth._

Psalms 150:6- Let everything that has breath praise the Lordüôåüèº
