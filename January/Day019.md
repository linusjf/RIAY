### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 19 - "VALLEY OF TEARS" Michelle Jackson

"To thee do we cry poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears" . Our Lord who understands our pain and suffering and is always with us. He who died for us and suffered for us comes to comfort and consoles us when we suffer. We are never alone and in our misery, when He was on the cross He gave His beloved disciple His Mother and Her to Him. Our mother who suffered seeing her son betrayed and crucified and experienced extreme sorrow and pain, like the pain of a sword piercing her heart ,that much sorrow she felt and suffered, she understands us when we go through pain and suffering. She comforts and consoles us with Jesus. Our pain is precious to them. When we understand and know the value of pain and suffering we can unite it to the sufferings of Jesus and Mamma Mary to be sanctified and purified by it. We are never alone. Our Lord and Mother understands us when we cry and cannot pray, for our tears become our silent prayers. Thank Yeshua Thank you Mamma for your LoveüôèüèΩ
