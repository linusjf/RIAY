  "image_prompt": "A serene, softly lit scene of a person kneeling in prayer before a simple wooden altar, hands gently clasped. A warm glow emanates from a candle flickering beside an open book of Scripture. The background is blurred with a suggestion of sacred artâ€”perhaps a faint depiction of a divine figure in muted golds and blues. The atmosphere is tranquil, with dust motes catching the light like tiny stars. The person's posture conveys both humility and quiet confidence, their face partially shadowed but peaceful, as if listening to an unseen presence. A single beam of light falls across their shoulders, symbolizing grace."
