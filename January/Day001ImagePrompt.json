  "image_prompt": "A serene, softly lit scene of a person kneeling in quiet prayer, hands gently clasped, eyes closed in deep contemplation. A rosary drapes loosely between their fingers, beads catching the warm glow of candlelight. In the background, a faint outline of a sacred icon or stained-glass window bathes the space in ethereal hues of blue and gold. The atmosphere is hushed, almost reverent, with delicate rays of light filtering through as if divine presence lingers just beyond sight. The composition evokes both intimacy and transcendence, blending human vulnerability with the quiet strength of faith."
