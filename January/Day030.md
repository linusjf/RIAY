### Rosary in a Year - Day 30 - Joyful Mysteries

1. The Visitation - Luke 1:39-56
   Mary is the new Ark of the Covenant in the NT as She conceives Jesus, who is the high priest (staff in the old Ark of Covenant), the bread of life (Jar of manna in the old Ark of Covenant) and the fulfilment and the giver of the law (ten commandments). Mary is the new meeting tent through whom God meets his people and leads them to victory (Salvation).
   As David brings the Ark of Covenant back to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6) the New Ark ( Mary) visits Elizabeth. Just like David felt unworthy of being given the privilige of bringing the Ark back, so does Elizabeth feel unworthy of the Lord's mother coming to visit her.
   In the OT there singing and dancing in front of the Ark, likewise, John the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb hearing Mary's greeting.
   Let us be renewed in Joy.

### AI-Generated Summary: The Ark New and Old and the Joy of God's Presence

Let us turn our minds, for a moment, to two scenes, separated by centuries but bound by a profound reality. The first takes us back to ancient Israel, to the Ark of the Covenant. This was no mere box, but a sacred chest, built to God's precise design, intended as the very dwelling place of His presence among His people. Within it lay the staff of Aaron, a pot of manna, and the tablets of the Law – symbols of priesthood, sustenance, and divine command. It was the heart of the Tabernacle, later the Temple, and the cloud of God's glory, the _Shekinah_, would fill that space, signifying His powerful, guiding presence, leading Israel to victory and meeting them there. Yet, in time, this glorious Ark was lost to history.

Now, consider a second scene, recounted by the Evangelist Luke: the Visitation. Mary, having received the Annunciation, travels to visit her cousin Elizabeth. Here, we perceive something remarkable, a parallel that Luke seems keen for us to grasp. Just as the Ark was the vessel of God's presence, Mary is presented as a new, living Ark, carrying within her the very Son of God – the true Bread from Heaven, the Giver of the new Law, our eternal High Priest.

Observe the striking similarities Luke draws between Mary's journey and the account in 2 Samuel chapter 6, where King David brings the old Ark to Jerusalem:

- Both journeys involve going to the "hill country."
- Upon arrival, expressions of unworthiness are voiced ("How can the ark of the Lord come to me?" and "Why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?").
- Most tellingly, both scenes are marked by exuberant joy – David dancing and leaping before the Ark, and John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth's womb before Mary.
- Both the Ark and Mary remain in the hill country for approximately three months.

It seems clear, then, that Luke intends for us to see Mary as the New Ark, bearing the true presence of God.

What does this mean for us? The old Ark was the source of Israel's guidance and victory because God was _there_. The Visitation reveals that God is now present with us in an even more intimate way, dwelling in Jesus, carried by Mary. And the fruit of this presence, as shown by Elizabeth and John, is immense joy.

Perhaps we, who have God present in Jesus – in the Blessed Sacrament, in prayer, through His Mother – sometimes lack this vibrant joy. This contemplation of Mary, the New Ark, and the joyful Visitation should stir us to seek a renewed awareness of God's presence, trusting that He is indeed with us, ready to guide, meet, teach, and bring us victory, just as He promised. Such reflection naturally draws us into prayer, seeking that very presence and the joy it bestows.
