### AI-Generated Summary: The Sacred Dance of Prayer  

To pray is not merely to speak, but to listen; not to perform, but to surrender. Begin as you would with a dear friend—by quieting the restless mind and acknowledging the One who is already near. Let your first act be stillness: a breath, a glance upon sacred art, a whispered verse. For God does not wait beyond some distant gate; He is here, and to raise the heart to Him is but to wake to what is ever true.  

Consider the Rosary not as a task to be completed, but as a path to be walked, step by step. Begin with a single decade, as a child learns to walk before he runs. Let each bead be a meeting place where love is given and received. In time, what once felt halting—like the first uncertain steps of a dance—will become a rhythm of grace.  

Prayer is, at its heart, an act of faith: to offer up our tangled hopes and hidden fears, and in return, to receive the peace that the world cannot give. Do not be troubled if it feels strange at first. Even the saints began as beginners. Persist, and you will find what all the saints have known—that in the quiet surrender of prayer, the soul is met, held, and transformed by Love Himself.  

And so we lift our hearts, not alone, but as children of Mary, who teaches us to say with her, *"Be it done unto me according to Thy word."* For in the end, prayer is not our work, but His—a gift already given, waiting only to be unwrapped.
