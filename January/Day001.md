### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope.
What we believe in should change us
Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God
Our body and soul should connect when we pray
Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us\*üò¢
We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.\*
We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thank you Lord for this relationship you give us through prayerüôè

### AI-Generated Summary: The Sacred Dance of Prayer

To pray is not merely to speak, but to listen; not to perform, but to surrender. Begin as you would with a dear friend‚Äîby quieting the restless mind and acknowledging the One who is already near. Let your first act be stillness: a breath, a glance upon sacred art, a whispered verse. For God does not wait beyond some distant gate; He is here, and to raise the heart to Him is but to wake to what is ever true.

Consider the Rosary not as a task to be completed, but as a path to be walked, step by step. Begin with a single decade, as a child learns to walk before he runs. Let each bead be a meeting place where love is given and received. In time, what once felt halting‚Äîlike the first uncertain steps of a dance‚Äîwill become a rhythm of grace.

Prayer is, at its heart, an act of faith: to offer up our tangled hopes and hidden fears, and in return, to receive the peace that the world cannot give. Do not be troubled if it feels strange at first. Even the saints began as beginners. Persist, and you will find what all the saints have known‚Äîthat in the quiet surrender of prayer, the soul is met, held, and transformed by Love Himself.

And so we lift our hearts, not alone, but as children of Mary, who teaches us to say with her, _"Be it done unto me according to Thy word."_ For in the end, prayer is not our work, but His‚Äîa gift already given, waiting only to be unwrapped.
