### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope.
What we believe in should change us
Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God
Our body and soul should connect when we pray
Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us\*üò¢
We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.\*
We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thank you Lord for this relationship you give us through prayerüôè

### AI-Generated Summary: The Gentle Art of Divine Conversation

To pray is not to batter heaven with words, but to open the soul‚Äôs door to the One who stands always knocking. Begin simply, as a child learns to walk‚Äîone step, then another. A single decade of prayer, offered with the heart‚Äôs attention, is worth more than a torrent of hurried words. For prayer is not arithmetic; it is the lifting of the mind and heart to God, a quiet recognition that He is here, nearer than our own breath.

Before you speak, pause. Let the soul grow still, as a pool settles to reflect the sky. Breathe deeply, gaze upon sacred art, or let Scripture whisper to you‚Äînot as a task, but as a friend‚Äôs voice across a shared silence. God does not demand eloquence; He asks only that you come, as you are, and receive His presence. This is the dance of prayer: at first, your steps may falter, your rhythm feel unnatural. Yet grace moves with you, and in time, what was effort becomes as natural as breathing.

Offer Him your fears, your hopes, your tangled desires‚Äînot as one casting a letter into the void, but as a child placing a gift into a Father‚Äôs hands. Then wait. For prayer is not monologue, but dialogue; He speaks in the stillness, in the sudden peace that comes unbidden, in the quiet shaping of the heart. End as you began: in love, in trust, in the ancient words that have carried saints before you. Thus, the soul grows deep, and heaven draws near.
