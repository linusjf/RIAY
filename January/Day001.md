### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro _when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope._
_What we believe in should change us_
_Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God_
_Our body and soul should connect when we pray_
\_Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us*ü•π
\_We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.*
\_We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thank you Lord for this relationship you give us through prayerüôè
