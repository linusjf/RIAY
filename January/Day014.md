### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 14 - "BLESSED ARE YOU" Michelle Jackson

"Blesses are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, JESUS". these words found in scripture tell us that Mamma Mary was not like any other woman on the earth. She was God's most unique master piece. Chosen to bear Jesus, God in her womb. When our lady visited elizabeth, she was filled with the HolySpirit at her greeting and she cried out with a shout of Joy. Calling her blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Mamma Mary is the God bearer and the HolySpirit dwells in her. She gave us Jesus, and we need to ask for that grace to honour her as God did and as Elizabeth did. Lord help us to love and rejoice in the blessed mother as you love and rejoice in her.. and when we pray the Hail Mary may we encounter her in Joy, and be filled with the HolySpirit 😇🙏🏽
