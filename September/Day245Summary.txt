### AI-Generated Summary: On the Final Mysteries

We are asked to consider the last steps of the great drama: the heavy weight of the Cross borne up the hill, the final anguish of the Crucifixion itself, and the quiet that followed. This is the depth of sorrow, the price paid. But the tale does not end in that silence. For the first Glorious Mystery shatters it, turning our minds from the tombâ€™s seal to its glorious emptiness, from the ultimate sacrifice to the ultimate victory. It is the reversal of all death, the first bright chapter in the story that changes everything.
