### AI-Generated Summary: On Certain Great Mysteries

We are bid to consider a progression of three great and solemn mysteries, as a man might climb a mountain from its darkest vale to its sunlit peak. The first is that final, terrible mystery of sorrow: the Crucifixion of Our Lord, where all the weight of a world's wrong was laid upon a single frame. From this depth of despair, we are then lifted—as indeed we are always lifted from such depths—to the first glorious mystery: the Resurrection. Here is the great reversal, the divine laughter that answers the world's grimace, the truth that a pierced hand has forever unlocked the door of death.

And being thus lifted, we are not left as orphans. For the final step in this ascent is the second glorious mystery: the Ascension. It is not a departure, but a coronation; the moment when the Man who walked with us passed through the very veil of the heavens to prepare a place, so that our own nature might forever have a share in the very life of God.
