### AI-Generated Summary: On Certain Great Mysteries

We are here invited to contemplate a progression of most weighty and solemn moments. First, we consider the glorious revelation upon the mountain, where the Lord’s face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light—a fleeting glimpse of the Reality behind all realities granted to the disciples. From that shining peak, we are led to the quiet upper room, to the institution of that great sacrament wherein common bread and wine are made vessels of an unutterable gift, the perpetual remembrance of His offering.

And so, from the luminous, we are brought gently, and yet with a dreadful inevitability, to the sorrowful beginning in the garden. There, we find not glory, but agony; not light, but the shadow of the cup that must be drunk. It is the picture of a will, in its human terror, bending itself to the Divine will, thus hallowing all our own lesser griefs and fears. This is the deep magic, the terrible and wonderful exchange at the heart of things.
