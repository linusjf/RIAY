### AI-Generated Summary: The Final Sorrowful Mysteries

We are brought to consider the final acts of a great suffering, where the King of all creation is made a mockery of a king, crowned not with gold but with thorns. Then follows the long and weary road, the bearing of the instrument of one's own death up the hill of execution. And at the last, the final mystery: the crucifixion itself, the ultimate price paid at the place of the skull. This is the heart of the matter, the sorrow that precedes the joy, the death that must come before the resurrection.
