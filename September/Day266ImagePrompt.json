  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych illustration depicting three scenes from the Glorious Mysteries. On the left, Christ ascends into a radiant heaven, his disciples gazing upward with awe. In the center, tongues of fire descend upon the gathered apostles in the upper room during Pentecost. On the right, the Blessed Virgin Mary is assumed into glory, surrounded by angels, her figure luminous against a celestial backdrop. The art style is inspired by illuminated manuscripts and stained glass, with rich colors, gold leaf accents, and a sense of sacred wonder, maintaining correct anatomy and perspective."
