### AI-Generated Summary: The Sorrowful Mysteries

We are invited to contemplate the profound and terrible weight of the Sorrowful Mysteries. The first finds a Man, wholly God, in a garden, bowed not by the weight of sin but by the full knowledge of it, accepting the bitter cup of a will not His own. From this agony of spirit, we are led to the second mystery: the Scourging. Here, the Love that spoke worlds into being submits to the cruelty of His creatures, His flesh torn by the whip, a physical torment endured for a healing we could not ourselves achieve.

The third mystery presents a darker mockery still. The soldiers, in their coarse humour, fashion a crown from thorns and press it upon His head. They clothe Him in purple, a king's colour, and offer a reed for a sceptre, thus making a ghastly pantomime of His true kingship. In this crowning, we see not only the infliction of a new and exquisite pain, but the worldâ€™s jeering rejection of the very principle of Glory it so desperately needs.
