    "caption": "A soul turns in devotion through the rhythm of repeated prayer.",
    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration of a person in deep meditation, their form subtly illuminated against a dark background. Their posture is natural and focused, with hands clasped in prayer, anatomically correct with five distinct fingers. The visual focus is on the abstract, emotional substance of devotion rather than a literal scene, with soft, ethereal light suggesting the Sorrowful Mysteries. The style is influenced by the gentle, expressive linework of Loish, conveying a profound sense of peace and spiritual turning."
