    "caption": "The sorrow of crucifixion gives way to the glorious hope of resurrection and ascension.",
    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration showing the progression from sorrow to glory. Left panel: A stark, sorrowful depiction of the Crucifixion at Calvary, with dramatic lighting emphasizing sacrifice. Central panel: The radiant Resurrection, with Christ emerging from a shattered tomb amidst brilliant light that breaks chains of darkness. Right panel: The Ascension, showing Christ rising bodily into heaven as apostles watch in awe, with clouds parting to reveal celestial light. The composition flows from dark to light, using a stylized yet anatomically faithful approach reminiscent of Glen Keane's expressive figure work, with careful perspective drawing the eye upward through the narrative journey."
