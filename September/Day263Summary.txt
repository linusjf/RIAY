### AI-Generated Summary: On the Concluding Mysteries

We are invited to consider the final three rays of light that proceed from the life of Our Lord, those mysteries which illuminate the path from proclamation to transfiguration, and thence to the most sacred of gifts. The third of these luminous mysteries calls to mind the Proclamation of the Kingdom, wherein the Master began His great work, bidding all men to a turning of the heart, a metanoia, that they might be ready to receive a kingship not of this world.

Then follows that great and terrible wonder, the fourth mystery: the Transfiguration. Here, upon the high place, the veil of His mortal frame was drawn back for a moment, and the glory that was always within shone forth before His chosen three, a foretaste of the glory that is to be revealed in us.

And so we come to the fifth and final light, the very source and summit: the Institution of the Eucharist. In the upper room, on the eve of His passion, He performed the ultimate alchemy, making of common bread His very Body, and of common wine His very Blood, a perpetual testament and sustenance for His children until the end of days.
