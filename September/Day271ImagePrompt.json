    "image_prompt": "A triptych of stylized, emotionally resonant concept art illustrating the Sorrowful Mysteries. Left panel: The Scourging at the Pillar, showing a figure bound to a rough-hewn stone pillar, back exposed and marked, rendered with a focus on solemn dignity and sacrifice in a style reminiscent of Loish. Central panel: The Crowning with Thorns, a close-up on a serene face bearing a intricately woven crown of sharp brambles, a subtle, painful light emanating from within, inspired by Glen Keane's expressive character art. Right panel: The Carrying of the Cross, a figure struggling under the immense weight of a large wooden cross on a dusty path towards a hill, the composition emphasizing the physical strain and spiritual resolve, with the atmospheric depth of a Studio Ghibli landscape. The overall image has a cohesive, muted color palette with dramatic lighting that highlights the emotional gravity of each station."
