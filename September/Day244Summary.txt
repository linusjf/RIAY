### AI-Generated Summary: The Strength Found in Sorrow

To pray but a single decade is a good thing, yet to pray three is to build a muscle of the soul, strengthening the will for a slower, deeper attention. This is the work of the first Sorrowful Mysteries: the Agony in the Garden, where a perfect will submitted to a bitter cup; the Scourging at the Pillar, where Love itself was torn by the whip; and the Crowning with Thorns, wherein the true King wore a crown of mockery. It is a hard road, this contemplation of suffering, but it is a transformative journey, one that offers not mere sentiment, but the very grace that is our salvation.
