    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed triptych illustration in the style of sacred Renaissance art with modern clarity. Left panel: A luminous mountain peak where a radiant figure with a sun-like face and glowing white robes stands before three awestruck disciples, with divine light breaking through clouds. Center panel: A quiet upper room at dusk, where figures gather around a simple table with bread and wine that seem to glow with an inner, supernatural light, casting soft shadows on reverent faces. Right panel: A dark garden at night, where a solitary figure in anguish kneels beneath ancient olive trees, face turned toward a shadowy cup that casts a long, terrible yet hallowed shadow, with hands clasped in prayer showing five distinct fingers. The composition flows seamlessly between panels with masterful perspective and atmospheric coherence, capturing both divine transcendence and human vulnerability."
