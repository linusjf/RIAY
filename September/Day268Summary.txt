The third is the Nativity itself, the humble and glorious arrival of the King in a stable. The fourth is the Presentation, where the infant Lord is brought to the Temple in accordance with the ancient Law. And the fifth, which seems to hold a particular lesson for parents and children alike, is the Finding in the Temple.

It contains all the necessary prayers and is filled with pictures, for a child, like the rest of us, must first be drawn in by a kind of beauty.
