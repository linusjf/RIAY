    "caption": "The meditation moves from the sorrow of the Cross to the glorious hope of the Resurrection.",
    "image_prompt": "A deeply symbolic and reverent triptych illustration. The left panel depicts a powerful, weary figure in a historical robe carrying a massive, rough-hewn wooden cross up a path, the weight bowing his shoulders under a stormy sky. The central panel shows the same cross now erected on a hill, a profound and solemn moment of sacrifice under a darkened sky. The right panel bursts with brilliant, golden morning light, revealing an empty tomb with the stone rolled away, surrounded by blooming flowers and a sense of victorious peace. The art style is epic and concept art-like, with strong lighting, rich colors, and meticulous detail, capturing both the gravity and the glory of the narrative in a spatially coherent and anatomically correct manner."
