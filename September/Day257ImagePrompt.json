    "caption": "The soul journeys from the luminous gift of the Eucharist into the gathering shadows of the Agony and the Scourging.",
    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style illustration in the manner of sacred Renaissance art. Left panel: A warmly lit, solemn scene of the Institution of the Eucharist in an upper room, with figures gathered around a table holding a luminous chalice. Right panel: A dark, moody transition to the Garden of Gethsemane under a starry night, showing a figure in prayerful agony, then a hard cut to the brutal, motion-blurred violence of the Scourging at a stone pillar. The composition masterfully guides the eye from light into shadow, maintaining perfect anatomical proportions and perspective, with a style influenced by the dramatic chiaroscuro of Caravaggio and the emotional depth of Albrecht DÃ¼rer's engravings."
