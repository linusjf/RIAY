### AI-Generated Summary: On Certain Rosary Mysteries

We are told of a boy, not yet a man, who was found in His Father’s house, speaking with the teachers and answering their questions. This is the fifth Joyful Mystery, the Finding in the Temple, which speaks to a truth we all, in our quieter moments, know: that the soul finds its true home not where it is coddled, but where it is challenged and where it may seek the source of all wisdom.

Then comes the light, breaking upon the world in a new way. The first Luminous Mystery shows us the Man at the river Jordan, baptized by His cousin, and the heavens themselves torn open to declare a beloved Son. It is the beginning of a public work, a quiet inauguration that thunders through the ages.

The second mystery of light takes us to a wedding feast in a small town, where the wine—that simple, gladdening drink of fellowship—runs short. At a mother’s gentle plea, water is turned to wine, not merely to save a family’s honour, but as a first sign; a quiet, joyful revelation of the glory that has come to dwell among us, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary.
