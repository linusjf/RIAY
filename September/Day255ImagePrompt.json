    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration depicting three sacred moments: left panel, a child presented in a ancient temple with soft light filtering through stone arches; center panel, the same child as a youth speaking with astonished scholars in a library filled with scrolls, his expression wise and serene; right panel, an adult figure standing in the Jordan River with heavens opening above, a radiant dove descending amid golden light. Art style inspired by Loish and Studio Ghibli, with warm colors, delicate linework, and emotionally expressive characters. Anatomically correct hands and faces, balanced composition with spiritual atmosphere."
