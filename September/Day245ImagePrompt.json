    "image_prompt": "A powerful diptych-style illustration. The left panel depicts the heavy weight of the Cross being borne up a hill under a dark, sorrowful sky, showing the depth of sacrifice with profound emotion. The right panel bursts with radiant, golden light, focusing on a gloriously empty tomb with the stone rolled away, symbolizing the ultimate victory over death and the reversal of all despair. The art style is emotionally resonant concept art, with strong lighting contrasts and anatomically correct figures, influenced by the narrative power of artists like Loish and the spiritual gravity of Studio Ghibli."
