The pages glow with a soft, ethereal light, from which semi-transparent, luminous forms of a rosary, a dove, and a radiant heart emerge, symbolizing the Hail Mary, Our Father, and Glory Be. The style is influenced by the serene and heartfelt artistry of Studio Ghibli, with anatomically correct, peaceful hands with five distinct fingers gently resting on the page's edge. The composition is balanced and cohesive, with a warm, contemplative atmosphere and a shallow depth of field."
