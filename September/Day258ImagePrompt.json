    "image_prompt": "A deeply moving, somber illustration in the style of classical religious art, depicting a weary, sorrowful king figure wearing a crown of thorns. He struggles under the immense weight of a large wooden cross as he ascends a steep, rocky path towards a hilltop execution site, known as the place of the skull. The scene is rendered with dramatic lighting, emphasizing his suffering and sacrifice, with a dark, stormy sky overhead. His posture is natural yet burdened, his face is anatomically correct and visible, conveying profound anguish and resolve, his hands gripping the rough wood with five distinct fingers. The overall mood is one of solemn gravity and profound sorrow preceding a promised resurrection."
