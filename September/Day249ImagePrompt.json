    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, reverent triptych illustration depicting three biblical scenes in a unified celestial light. Left panel: Jesus being baptized in the Jordan River, with a dove descending and a beam of light from heaven, figures on the bank witnessing. Central panel: The wedding at Cana, Jesus with outstretched hand transforming water into wine in large stone jars, guests reacting with joy and astonishment. Right panel: Jesus preaching on a hillside to a diverse crowd, gesturing with open hands, his expression compassionate and authoritative. The overall style is inspired by classical religious art with accurate anatomy, deep perspective, and a warm, luminous glow that connects all three scenes, emphasizing divine manifestation in the world."
