    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style digital painting depicting a spiritual ascent. The left panel shows a dark, somber valley with a stark crucifixion scene, rendered with profound gravity and sorrow. The central panel bursts with radiant, golden light as a figure rises from a tomb, symbolizing the Resurrection with divine energy and hope. The right panel depicts the Ascension, with the same figure gloriously ascending through parted clouds into a brilliant, heavenly realm, wearing a crown and leaving a trail of light, while below, awe-struck figures look on. The art style is influenced by the dramatic lighting and anatomical faithfulness of classical religious masters like Caravaggio and Michelangelo, combined with the expressive linework of modern concept art, ensuring correct perspective and spatial coherence."
