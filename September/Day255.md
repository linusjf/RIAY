### AI-Generated Summary: On Three Mysteries

We are told of a child, presented in the temple according to the old law, a sign of obedience and humility. Then comes the finding of the same child, not lost but about his Fatherâ€™s business, astounding the learned men with his understanding. And from these joys we move to a light unveiled at the river Jordan, where the heavens themselves were opened at his baptism, and the Voice declared the beloved Son. In these things we see the pattern: the humble act, the divine revelation, and the quiet, staggering truth that the ordinary world is charged with a grandeur it cannot contain.
