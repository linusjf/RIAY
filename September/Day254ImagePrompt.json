    "image_prompt": "A stylized, serene illustration in the manner of Studio Ghibli concept art, depicting a worn, gentle path through a peaceful landscape at dusk. The path is softly illuminated by five glowing, ancient pillars arranged in a circle, each pillar representing a Joyful Mystery: one shows the Archangel Gabriel, another shows two women embracing, and a central one glows with the light of a manger. A silhouetted figure walks the path with a posture of humble devotion, their heart visibly oriented toward the glowing pillars. The scene is anatomically correct and spatially coherent, with a steady, rhythmic feeling in the composition."
