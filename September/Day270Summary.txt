### AI-Generated Summary: On the Mysteries of Light and Sorrow

You will have observed that the final steps along the way of Light lead us to a great height and then to a quiet room. The fourth of these Luminous Mysteries is the Transfiguration, where, upon the mountain, the Masterâ€™s face shone like the sun and his clothes became as light itself, and the Law and the Prophets, in the persons of Moses and Elijah, were seen conversing with him. This was a glimpse of the country we are made for, a sudden brightness breaking through the familiar human form.

From that peak, we are brought down to the fifth mystery, the Institution of the Holy Eucharist. Here, in the upper room, He performed the ultimate alchemy, taking the common stuff of bread and wine and making them the vehicle of His own life, a perpetual fountain of grace for His children. It is the gift that bridges the chasm between His departure and our present need.

And then, as if the very light is swallowed by a gathering shadow, we pass from the Mysteries of Light to the first of the Sorrowful Mysteries: the Agony in the Garden. Here we find no radiance, but a man alone in the darkness, pressed down by a weight He alone could bear, praying in such anguish that his sweat fell like drops of blood. It is the beginning of the great reversal, where the will of the Son is freely given over to the will of the Father, and the long road to the redemption of the world is trod.
