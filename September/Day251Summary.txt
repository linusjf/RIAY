### AI-Generated Summary: On the Reiteration of Prayer

My dear reader, one finds in this text not a discourse or a story, but the very substance of devotion itselfâ€”the repeated and heartfelt recitation of prayer. It is the meditation on the Sorrowful Mysteries that forms the core: the Scourging at the Pillar, the Crowning with Thorns, and the Carrying of the Cross. These are not merely recounted but entered into through the familiar and comforting rhythm of the Hail Mary, the Our Father, and the Glory Be. The text is the vessel for this act of worship, a gentle and persistent turning of the soul toward a sacred focus, culminating in a simple expression of gratitude. There is no art here to describe, for the action itself is the object.
