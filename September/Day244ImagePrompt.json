    "image_prompt": "A stylized, emotionally resonant triptych illustration in the vein of Loish or Studio Ghibli, depicting the three Sorrowful Mysteries as a transformative journey. Left panel: A figure in a garden under a starry night, head bowed in prayer, accepting a luminous, bitter cup. Center panel: The same figure bound to a pillar, back turned, with light emanating from the wounds of a spiritual scourging. Right panel: The figure now seated, wearing a crown of sharp, dark thorns that contrast with a serene and kingly expression, a single tear tracing a path down a cheek. The overall composition is cohesive, with a path connecting the three scenes, symbolizing a journey. The style is soft yet detailed, with anatomically correct hands and expressive, sorrowful yet peaceful faces visible in each panel."
