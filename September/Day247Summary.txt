### AI-Generated Summary: On a Certain Kind of Prayer

We are told of a soul at its prayers, moving through the sacred pattern of the Glorious and Joyful Mysteries. It first contemplates that final and most glorious truth: the Coronation of our Lady as Queen of Heaven. From that height, it turns back to the beginning of joy, to the Annunciation—that great disturbance of the universe where a Virgin is saluted and consents—and then to the Visitation, where blessing is carried from one house to another and joy leaps in the womb.

The rest, as you have found, is not a tale to be summarized but a practice to be performed; the well-worn paths of the *Hail Mary* and the *Our Father*, which are not the window through which we look at the landscape, but the very footsteps of the walker upon the road itself.
