    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style digital painting in the vein of sacred Renaissance art, depicting three scenes of profound sorrow. Left panel: A divine figure, illuminated by a soft, sorrowful light, kneels in a dark garden of gnarled olive trees, head bowed in anguish, accepting a glowing, bitter chalice. Central panel: The same figure, now with a serene but pained expression, stands bound to a pillar as shadowy figures wield whips, his back torn but his posture embodying sacrificial love. Right panel: A dark, stone room where soldiers in rough armor mockingly place a brutally sharp crown of thorns upon his head, which draws blood, while they offer a reed scepter and a robe of faded purple. The overall style is deeply emotive, with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, rich but somber colors, and anatomically correct, expressive hands and faces conveying the weight of each moment."
