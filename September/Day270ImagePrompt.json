    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style concept art illustration. On the left, a mountain peak under a radiant sky, where a figure with a face shining like the sun wears robes of pure light, conversing with two ancient, luminous prophets. On the right, a dark garden at night where a solitary figure kneels in anguish, head bowed under an immense, shadowy weight, with beads of sweat like blood falling to the ground. The transition between the two scenes is a dramatic shift from brilliant, hopeful light to deep, sorrowful shadow, rendered in the emotionally charged, stylized linework of artists like Glen Keane."
