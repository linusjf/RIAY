### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Luminous Mysteries

We are invited to consider the first of these Luminous Mysteries, which are themselves a proclamation of that Light which came into the world. The first is the Baptism in the Jordan, where the voice of the Father declares the Son, and the Spirit, in the form of a dove, confirms the truth of the thing. The second mystery is the manifestation at the wedding in Cana, where the water of mere custom was made the wine of joy by His who commands all matter. The third is the Proclamation of the Kingdom, with its call to repentance and the promise of a comfort that the world cannot give. In these, we see the pattern of Heaven breaking through, not to destroy the world, but to fill it, as light fills a room.
