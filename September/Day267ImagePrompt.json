    "image_prompt": "A stylized, contemplative illustration in the spirit of sacred iconography, showing a simple, well-worn path through a serene landscape at dusk. The path glows softly, shaped by countless unseen footsteps. To one side, a humble wooden rosary lies on a stone, its beads catching the last light. In the sky above, subtle, ethereal forms suggest the Coronation of Mary and the Annunciation, not as detailed figures but as luminous impressions of divine grace and humble consent. The overall mood is peaceful and meditative, with a focus on the spiritual resonance of repeated action over complex imagery."
