    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration depicting three mystical events. On the left, the Blessed Mother is assumed into heaven, surrounded by radiant light and angelic figures, her body and soul glowing with divine grace. In the center, she is crowned Queen of Heaven and Earth by her Son, seated on a majestic throne amidst the celestial court of the redeemed, who look on in adoration. On the right, the scene shifts to the Annunciation: the Archangel Gabriel breaks the great silence of heaven, appearing before the humble Virgin in a serene chamber; the world outside seems to pause, holding its breath. The art style is inspired by the luminous and anatomically precise detail of Renaissance masters combined with the expressive linework of Studio Ghibli, ensuring perfect perspective and spatial coherence. The Virgin's posture is natural and reverent, her hands and face clearly visible and perfectly formed."
