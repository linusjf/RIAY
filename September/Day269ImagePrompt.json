    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration depicting three scenes unified by a soft, luminous glow. Left panel: Jesus standing in the River Jordan, head bowed in humility, with a radiant dove descending from heavens torn open above. Central panel: A wedding feast at Cana, where Jesus, prompted by Mary, gestures towards stone jars; water visibly transforms into deep red wine, symbolizing joy and change. Right panel: Jesus preaching on a small hill, his hand extended in invitation, with a diverse crowd of listeners in a marketplace, their faces illuminated by the dawning light of the Kingdom. The art style is reminiscent of Loish or Glen Keane, with warm, saturated colors, soft edges, and expressive, anatomically correct figures, creating a sense of serene wonder and spiritual depth."
