### AI-Generated Summary: On the Sorrowful Mysteries

One finds in these fragments a path trod with solemn steps, a meditation on that great and terrible turning point which we call the Sorrowful Mysteries. The soul is led, as it were, to consider three particular stations along that dolorous way.

First, there is the Scourging at the Pillar, a contemplation of the Word made flesh subjected to the lash, bound to that cold stone not for His own transgressions, but for ours. Then follows the Crowning with Thorns, a bitter parody of kingship where cruelty masquerades as homage, pressing a crown not of gold but of piercing bramble upon the brow of the true King. And lastly, the Carrying of the Cross, that arduous journey to Calvary where the weight of the wood is but an outward sign of the far heavier burden of a worldâ€™s sin borne upon His shoulders.

These are not mere events of history, you understand, but mysteries into which we are invited to enter, that we might find, hidden in their very heart of darkness, the seeds of a brighter dawn.
