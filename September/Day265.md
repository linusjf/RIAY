### AI-Generated Summary: The Weight and the Glory

We find ourselves, dear reader, at the very crux of the matter, where the long road of sorrow turns at last toward the uncreated light. The meditation begins with that terrible, glorious burden—the Carrying of the Cross. Here we see the Divine, in the person of Christ, taking the full weight of that rough timber and of a world’s sin upon His shoulders, a picture of every small and great suffering we are asked to bear.

From this we move to the fifth and final sorrow: the Crucifixion itself. This is the great contradiction, the moment where Life Himself submits to death, where the King is enthroned upon a cross. It is not a morbid fixation, but a solemn contemplation of the price paid, the ultimate act of love that purchased humanity’s redemption.

And then, as if a door had been flung open in a silent house, the meditation turns at once to the first Glorious Mystery: the Resurrection. This is the great rebuttal to despair, the event that shatters the finality of the tomb. It is the third day, the new dawn, the vindication of every hope and the promise that death itself is but a sleep from which we shall all awake.

The prayers themselves—the repeated Ave Marias, the Paternoster, the Gloria—are not incantations but the steady rhythm of the heart turning these things over, much as one turns a precious stone in the hand to see it catch the light from different angles. They are the humble means by which the soul attends to the reality behind the mystery. The text provides the simple, faithful structure for this attendance, a path walked in prayerful repetition toward a truth that is never repetitive, but ever new.
