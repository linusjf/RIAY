  "image_prompt": "A deeply reverent and luminous scene in an ancient upper room at twilight, depicting the Institution of the Eucharist. Jesus Christ, with a serene and compassionate expression, holds a piece of bread that glows with a soft, divine inner light, offering it to his apostles who are gathered around a simple wooden table. The apostles display a mix of awe, wonder, and devotion, their faces and hands rendered with anatomically correct detail. The atmosphere is warm and sacred, with shadows dancing from a single oil lamp and a heavenly ray of light illuminating the central act. The style is a masterful blend of Renaissance chiaroscuro and the profound spiritual gravity of artists like Georges de La Tour, focusing on the emotional weight and the moment of divine transformation."
