### AI-Generated Summary: On Certain Mysteries

We are told of a progression of wonders, beginning with the fourth, where the Blessed Mother, having finished her course, was assumed, body and soul, into the glory that awaits all who are in her Son. This is followed by the fifth, her Coronation, where she is rightly honoured as Queen of Heaven and Earth by the whole court of the redeemed. And from this glory, the telling turns back to the first beginning: the Annunciation. Here, the great silence of heaven was broken as the messenger was sent to the Virgin, and the world, holding its breath, received its answer.
