### AI-Generated Summary: On Sorrows and Glories

My dear reader, one finds in these mysteries a pattern as old as the world itselfâ€”that the deepest sorrow must ever give way to a greater glory. First comes the fifth sorrowful mystery, the Crucifixion, where the King is nailed to the wood and completes His work at Calvary. It is the final, terrible price.

But see how the story does not end there. For the first glorious mystery is the Resurrection, where on the third day He rises, shattering the very chains of death. And then, as a man might return home after a long campaign, the second glorious mystery shows us the Ascension. Forty days after His rising, He ascends bodily into heaven, leaving His apostles not as orphans, but as witnesses to a promise fulfilled. This is the true order of things: from the darkest Friday dawns the brightest Sunday, and from the dust of this world, we are shown the path to the next.
