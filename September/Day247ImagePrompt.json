  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration of a translucent, glowing soul figure walking along a path that transforms beneath its feet. The path ahead is paved with shimmering, celestial light leading up to a distant, radiant vision of the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, crowned with stars. The path behind the figure shows earlier moments: the Visitation, where two embraced women are surrounded by a soft, golden light, and the Annunciation, depicted as a great cosmic disturbance with a beam of light from heaven and a dove descending towards a kneeling virgin. The style is inspired by the luminous, flowing art of Studio Ghibli, with anatomically correct, expressive hands and faces filled with awe and contemplation."
