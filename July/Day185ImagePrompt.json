  "image_prompt": "A Byzantine-Gothic style painting depicting the risen Christ, clad in rich crimson and blue robes, standing atop a golden hill with hands raised in blessing. Below Him, a group of apostles—young and old—gather on a textured, rocky slope, their faces filled with wonder and devotion. The background merges heavenly gold with earthy tones, creating a sacred atmosphere. The mountain, though stylized, suggests depth, as if the ground itself trembles under the weight of this divine encounter. Soft light bathes the scene, emphasizing the solemnity of Christ's commission to spread His word."
