### AI-Generated Summary: The Dawn of Everlasting Life

The resurrection of Christ is no mere historical curiosity, dear reader, but the very hinge upon which the universe turns—a sudden and glorious eruption of life where death had reigned. It is as if the first true morning broke upon a world that had known only twilight, scattering the shadows with a light no darkness can quench. This is the Paschal candle’s promise: that the old order of decay is undone, and a new creation stirs within the womb of time.

Consider Caravaggio’s _The Incredulity of Saint Thomas_—how the wounded Lord, with infinite patience, guides the trembling hand of doubt to touch the very scars that seal our hope. Here is the Baroque’s bold truth: divine mercy leans low to meet us in our unbelief. The painting, like the resurrection itself, is an invitation: not to spectate, but to partake.

And so the ancient prayers echo—_Our Father_, _Hail Mary_, _Glory Be_—not as incantations, but as the heartbeat of a life reborn. For if death could not hold Him, neither shall it claim those who are His. The world’s glories fade like grass; yet here stands the undying thing, the love that will not let us go.
