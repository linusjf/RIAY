  "image_prompt": "A detailed fresco in the style of Agostino Chiappelli depicting the Flagellation of Christ. The scene is bathed in dramatic chiaroscuro, with deep shadows contrasting the ethereal glow of Christ's halo. His figure, bound to a pillar, bears the marks of scourging, yet His expression remains serene, embodying divine endurance. Roman soldiers wielding whips encircle Him, their faces twisted with exertion. The background suggests a dimly lit stone chamber, but rays of golden light pierce through, symbolizing hope and redemption. The composition balances brutality and grace, with intricate textures in the robes, flesh, and architecture evoking Renaissance artistry."
