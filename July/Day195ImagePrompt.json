  "image_prompt": "A dimly lit wedding feast in ancient Cana, with stone water jars glowing faintly in the background. At the center, Jesus in simple robes gestures with quiet authority toward the vessels, his face softly illuminated as servants pour out deep crimson wine into goblets. The bride and groom stand awestruck nearby, their faces bathed in warm light, while Mary watches with serene knowing from the shadows. The scene hums with unspoken wonder, the air thick with the scent of grapes and fresh bread, capturing the moment ordinary water becomes a foretaste of divine joy."
