  "image_prompt": "A softly lit stable at night, with a wooden manger at the center holding a radiant newborn child wrapped in simple cloth. The child's gentle glow casts warm light on the faces of Mary and Joseph, who kneel in quiet reverence. Rough-hewn wooden beams frame the scene, with strands of hay scattered on the earthen floor. A faint golden halo surrounds the child, illuminating the curious faces of nearby animalsâ€”a donkey, an ox, and sheep peering in. Through a small opening in the stable wall, a single bright star shines in the deep blue night sky, its light converging with the child's glow. The atmosphere is hushed and sacred, with a sense of awe and stillness, as if all creation holds its breath."
