  "caption": "A radiant figure stands atop a mountain, light emanating from within, as shadows of prophets bow and vanish into the silent clarity of divine presence.",
  "image_prompt": "A solitary figure, glowing with an inner light, stands at the peak of a mist-covered mountain. The light is warm and golden, casting long shadows behind two fading figures—one holding stone tablets, the other clad in prophetic robes—bowing in reverence before disappearing. Below, a chaotic world of flickering artificial lights and noise contrasts with the serene, luminous summit. The sky above is deep indigo, scattered with faint stars, emphasizing the divine radiance. The composition mirrors Raphael's harmony, with earthly confusion at the base and celestial clarity above, capturing the moment of transfiguration and quiet awe."
