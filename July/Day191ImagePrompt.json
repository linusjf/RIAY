  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-style Nativity scene in a rustic stable, illuminated by a soft, golden heavenly light. Mary, with a serene and tender expression, cradles the infant Jesus, wrapped in delicate swaddling clothes. Joseph stands nearby, his weathered face filled with quiet reverence. The stable is adorned with rough-hewn wood and scattered hay, while angels hover subtly in the background, their presence hinted at by ethereal glows. The atmosphere is one of profound peace and divine intimacy, as if time itself has paused to honor this sacred moment."
