### AI-Generated Summary: The Heart of Prayer as Communion with the Father

Prayer, dear friend, is not chiefly a matter of words, nor even of requests, but of coming awake to the living presence of the Father. He is no distant sovereign, but One who sees you plainly, hears you gladly, and takes delight in your turning toward Him. Wherever you kneel—be it a chapel or a kitchen corner—He is there, nearer than your own breath. This is the great secret: to remember that prayer is the meeting of a child with his Father, and all else flows from that. The repetitions of devotion, like well-worn paths, are but means to steady the wandering mind until it rests in Him. Let this truth sink deep—your Father waits, and in that knowing, all prayer begins.
