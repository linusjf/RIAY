  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Renaissance-style painting depicting Christ falling under the weight of the cross on the way to Calvary. His thorn-crowned head is bowed, yet His eyes meet those of the Virgin Mary, who stands with arms outstretched in a gesture of offering and sorrow. The composition is vertical, drawing the viewer's gaze upward, emphasizing the spiritual significance of the moment. Surrounding them is a tumultuous crowd: soldiers with blood-red banners, a stranger helping to bear the cross, and two other condemned men in the background. The scene is bathed in a chiaroscuro light, highlighting the emotional intensity and the sacred connection between mother and son. The painting evokes a sense of divine sacrifice, human suffering, and the intertwining of wills in the redemptive act."
