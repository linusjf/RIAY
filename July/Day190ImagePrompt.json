  "image_prompt": "A luminous depiction of Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant, her figure glowing with divine grace as she cradles the unseen presence of Christ within her. She stands in a humble yet sacred landscape, perhaps on the path to visit Elizabeth, with golden light spilling from her as a symbol of the divine Word she carries. Around her, faint echoes of angelic hymns and the Magnificat swirl in the air, blending with the natural world—flowers bowing in reverence, the sky alight with dawn’s promise. Elizabeth, in the distance, reaches out with awe, her own figure touched by the radiance of Mary’s joy. The scene is tender yet majestic, a fusion of human love and heavenly mystery."
