  "image_prompt": "A softly lit, intimate scene of a small kitchen corner at dusk. A child kneels by a wooden chair, hands clasped in prayer, their face peaceful and earnest. A warm golden light spills from a nearby window, casting gentle shadows. The simplicity of the space—a worn table, a half-empty cup, a loaf of bread—speaks of quiet devotion. The air seems to shimmer slightly around the child, suggesting a divine presence, tender and close. The atmosphere is one of deep trust and belonging, as if heaven leans near to hear."
