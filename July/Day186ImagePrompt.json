Around her, disciples with upturned faces, their expressions filled with awe as tongues of flame hover above their heads. A radiant dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit illuminates the darkened space, casting dramatic shadows. The composition is rich in detail, with flowing robes, intricate gestures, and a heavenly glow that contrasts with the deep background, evoking a sense of divine presence and sacred stillness."
