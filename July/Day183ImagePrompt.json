  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-style painting depicting the Descent from the Cross, inspired by Rubens. The lifeless body of Christ, pale and wounded, is being gently lowered by trembling hands. His mother, Mary, dressed in deep mourning blue, reaches toward him with profound grief. The scene is rich with emotion—saints and mourners surround them, their faces etched with sorrow. The cross looms in the background, its wood rough and stained. Light falls dramatically, highlighting Christ's wounds—the nails, the crown of thorns, and the pierced side. The atmosphere is heavy with reverence, capturing both agony and the promise of redemption."
