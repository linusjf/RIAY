  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque painting depicting the Descent from the Cross, with a brooding navy sky and a heavy wooden cross. The pale, lifeless body of Christ is being carefully lowered by mourners, His wounds visible and flesh drained of color. The Virgin Mary, draped in sorrowful blue robes, reaches with trembling hands toward her Son, her face a portrait of quiet, profound grief. Chiaroscuro lighting carves deep shadows and highlights, emphasizing the folds of fabric and anguished expressions. The scene balances raw agony with dignified restraint, capturing both the horror of sacrifice and the promise of redemption. The composition is dynamic yet ordered, with figures arranged to draw the eye toward Christ's body, while subtle details—like tear-streaked faces and whispered prayers—hint at unseen hope."
