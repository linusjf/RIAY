### AI-Generated Summary: The Choice Between Rebellion and Obedience

You will find, dear reader, that sin is not merely the breaking of rules but the turning away from Love Himself. The prodigal son, in his grasping for independence, spurned his father’s house—not just his wealth, but his very presence. So it is with us: sin is the heart’s foolish whisper that we might fare better alone, severed from the Source of all good.

Yet behold the Son of God in Gethsemane (as depicted by Vicente Macip in his painting _Prayer of Jesus in Gethsemane Garden_), who in His agony did not clutch at His own will but surrendered it, saying, "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt." Here is the perfect counter to our rebellion: obedience rooted in love, trust that clings to the Father even when the cup is bitter. The painter Massip, in his rendering of Judas, shows us a man poised between light and darkness—his halo half-gold, half-black—as if to say that even then, mercy waited, had he but turned back.

Let us then fix our eyes not on the shadows of fear or the weight of suffering, but on the Guide who has walked this path before us. For in Christ’s submission lies our victory, and in His obedience, our hope.
