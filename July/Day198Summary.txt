### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Feast of Love  

Consider the Eucharist, dear reader, not as a mere rite but as the very heart of Christ’s love made tangible. Here, in bread and wine, He offers Himself—not as a distant sovereign, but as a lover who longs to dwell within us. Think of His quiet peace at that final supper, knowing full well the agony ahead, yet choosing trust over fear. This is the mystery: that divine love should stoop so low to lift us so high.  

In *The Last Supper*, that mosaic by Giacomo Raffaele, we glimpse this very paradox—the calm of Christ amid the gathering storm. His repose is no accident; it is the fruit of perfect surrender to the Father’s will. So too, in every Eucharist, He invites us to lay down our anxieties and take up His peace.  

What folly it would be to approach such a gift lightly! For in this sacrament lies not a symbol, but the Savior Himself—an "abyss of love" where we are drawn into His life, His joy, His suffering. Let us then receive Him not with haste, but with hearts open to transformation, that we may learn to trust as He trusted, and love as He loved.
