  "image_prompt": "A dramatic seascape inspired by Rembrandt's *Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee*, with towering waves crashing against a small boat. The disciples are shown in various states of fear and desperation, their faces illuminated by flickering lantern light. At the center, Christ sits calmly, His expression serene yet authoritative, one hand raised as if to command the storm. The sky is a tumultuous mix of dark clouds and slivers of divine light breaking through, symbolizing His sovereignty. The composition balances chaos and peace, with the viewer's eye drawn to Christ as the focal point amid the turmoil."
