  "image_prompt": "Three women in flowing robes of red, blue, and gold stand before a glowing angel at the entrance of a stone tomb. The soft light of dawn bathes the scene, casting delicate shadows on their facesâ€”expressions of shock, wonder, and dawning hope. The angel, with outstretched hand and luminous wings, gestures toward the open tomb, its interior shrouded in mystery. The folds of the women's garments ripple with movement, as if caught in a divine breeze. The surrounding landscape is sparse but evocative, with hints of distant hills and a sky transitioning from night to morning. The composition balances Baroque dynamism with intimate emotion, emphasizing the pivotal moment of revelation."
