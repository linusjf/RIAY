  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-inspired scene of a luminous dawn breaking over a shadowed landscape, centered on a towering Paschal candle whose golden flame casts radiant light. In the foreground, a figure resembling Caravaggio's Christ gently guides a doubting hand toward the wound in his side, the scars glowing softly. The composition is rich with chiaroscuro—deep contrasts of light and dark—symbolizing the triumph of resurrection over death. Ethereal hints of prayer texts (Our Father, Hail Mary) float like gilded whispers in the air, while the background suggests a crumbling tomb and fresh spring flowers pushing through cracked stone."
