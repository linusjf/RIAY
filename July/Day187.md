### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Exchange Between Mother and Son

Consider the _Assumption of Mary_, that radiant work in Burgos Cathedral, where glass and light conspire to tell a tale older than the world. Here, the Virgin ascends, haloed in gold, borne upon azure clouds by angels whose wings are fragments of heaven’s own palette. Below, two saints tend a garden where a tomb lies empty—a silent witness to the victory she now shares. The disciples gaze upward, their faces alight with wonder, as Gothic tracery weaves their awe into the very stone.

Now mark the deeper truth: as Mary once clothed the Christ-child in swaddling bands, so He, transfigured, wore a garment “dazzling white”—some say of her making. What poetry in this! For as she gave Him flesh, He returns to her the raiment of divinity. Augustine saw it plainly: His flesh was hers; now His glory is hers. She who nursed Him, mourned Him, offered Him up, is herself lifted up, dressed in light, assumed beyond the reach of death.

This is the law of Heaven’s economy: give all, receive more. Mary gave her Son the humble service of a mother; He gives her the splendor of a queen. And so it is with all who follow Him—what we surrender, He transfigures; what we offer in love, He crowns with eternity. The Assumption is but the firstfruits of a harvest meant for us all.
