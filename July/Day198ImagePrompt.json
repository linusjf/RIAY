  "image_prompt": "A softly lit, intimate scene of a long wooden table set for the Last Supper, with warm golden light casting gentle shadows. At the center, Christ sits in serene repose, His hands outstretched over bread and wine, His expression a blend of quiet sorrow and boundless love. The disciples are gathered around Him, their faces illuminated with awe and confusion, some leaning in, others withdrawn in thought. The background is a mosaic-like texture, reminiscent of Giacomo Raffaele’s work, with subtle hints of an approaching storm outside the window—dark clouds contrasted by a single shaft of heavenly light breaking through. The atmosphere is thick with reverence and mystery, as if time itself has paused for this sacred moment."
