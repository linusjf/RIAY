  "image_prompt": "A serene, softly lit scene of a solitary figure kneeling in a humble, dimly lit room, hands clasped gently. A warm, golden light spills from an unseen source, casting delicate shadows. The air is filled with a sense of quiet devotion, as if time has slowed. Outside the window, a vast night sky with faint stars suggests the divine presence. The figure's posture exudes surrender and trust, while subtle details—a worn prayer book, a single candle flickering—hint at sincerity over ritual. The atmosphere is peaceful, intimate, and weighted with unspoken love."
