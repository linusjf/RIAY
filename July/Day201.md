### Thorns for Love

### AI-Generated Summary: The Mockery of Kings and the Sovereignty of Suffering

Consider, dear reader, Titian (Tiziano Vecellio)'s painting of _The Crowning with Thorns_ (located in Musée du Louvre, Paris) where the Eternal King submits to the cruelty of men. Here, the thorns pressed upon His brow are both a mockery and a coronation—earth’s scorn revealing heaven’s glory. The artist (be it Titian or another) sets beside Him the bust of Tiberius, that hollow sovereign of passing empires, as if to ask: _Which crown will you serve?_

The world has always traded truth for power, yet here is the true Power, wearing weakness as a diadem. Do not mistake this for mere tragedy; it is the divine irony by which God turns the world’s cruelty into the means of our redemption. The painting whispers what Scripture shouts: that every soul must choose between Caesar’s coin and Christ’s cross.

And what of us? We who flinch at suffering yet cling to comfort—do we not also weave thorns for Him when we prefer convenience to conviction? Repentance is but the act of laying down our petty crowns before the One who wore thorns for our sake. Let the image stir you: not to guilt, but to that quieter, deeper thing—a turning of the heart toward the only King worthy of all allegiance.
