  "image_prompt": "A grand Baroque-style fresco depicting the Virgin Mary enthroned in heavenly glory, crowned as Queen of Heaven, with the radiant Christ Child seated on her lap. Surrounding them are saints and angels in adoration—Saint Joseph holding a lily, martyrs with palms, confessors in prayer—all bathed in divine golden light. Above, the Eternal Father shines with uncreated radiance, the Holy Spirit as a dove hovering near. The scene is set upon luminous clouds, glowing as if lit from within, with an endless procession of celestial figures fading into the distance. The composition balances academic precision with dramatic Baroque movement, rich in deep blues, crimson, and gold, evoking both solemnity and sublime wonder."
