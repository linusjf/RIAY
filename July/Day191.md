### AI-Generated Summary: The Timeless Joy of the Nativity

Consider, dear reader, the scene laid before us: a humble stable, a mother’s tender gaze, a child wrapped in swaddling clothes—the very Word made flesh. Here is no sorrow, no shadow of regret, but pure, unblemished joy, as if heaven itself had stooped to kiss the earth. The artist Pellegrini, with his Baroque brush, captures not merely an event but an eternal truth: the divine has entered our frailty, and in that entering, all grief is undone.

Fitz, that man overwhelmed by an unlooked-for gift, mirrors what every soul ought to feel before the manger—a joy so sharp it borders on pain, for it is the joy of one who knows he is unworthy yet is loved all the same. This is the heart of the Nativity: God gives Himself, not as a distant king, but as a child, inviting us not to awe alone but to kinship.

Let us then, like Joseph and Mary in Pellegrini’s painting, adore with quiet wonder. For in this child lies the end of all sadness, the dawn of a joy that will not fade.
