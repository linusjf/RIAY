  "image_prompt": "A solemn yet radiant scene of Jesus carrying a heavy wooden cross, His face marked with both pain and determination. The path to Golgotha is rugged, dust swirling around His feet, while Roman soldiers loom in the background. Simon of Cyrene, a reluctant figure, supports part of the cross, his expression shifting from reluctance to dawning reverence. A golden light breaks through stormy skies, casting an ethereal glow on the cross, symbolizing its transformation from an instrument of death to a beacon of salvation. The atmosphere is heavy with sorrow yet charged with divine purpose, capturing the weight of sacrifice and the promise of redemption."
