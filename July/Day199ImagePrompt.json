  "image_prompt": "A dramatic, chiaroscuro-style painting depicting Judas Iscariot at the moment of his betrayal, his face half-lit by a golden halo and half-shrouded in darkness, symbolizing the tension between sin and redemption. Behind him, a faint glow suggests the outstretched hand of divine mercy, while the foreground is dominated by the shadowy silhouette of thirty pieces of silver scattered on the ground. The background merges the agony of Gethsemane with the distant, welcoming light of the father's house from the parable of the prodigal son, blending themes of rebellion and obedience into a single, poignant composition."
