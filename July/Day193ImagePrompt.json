  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-style painting set in an ancient temple, with a twelve-year-old boy seated among elderly scholars, his face illuminated with divine wisdom. His parents, Mary and Joseph, stand at the entrance, their expressions a mix of relief, awe, and lingering concern. The temple is grand, with towering columns and soft golden light filtering through stained glass, casting intricate shadows. Mary clutches her robe near her heart, her eyes reflecting deep contemplation, while Joseph stands protectively beside her, his hand resting gently on her shoulder. The atmosphere is reverent, with hints of divine presence in the play of light and shadow."
