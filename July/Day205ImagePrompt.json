  "image_prompt": "A luminous, Renaissance-style painting depicting the moment of the Ascension. Christ, bathed in golden light, rises majestically into a sky of swirling clouds and divine radiance, His robes flowing as He ascends. Below, on the rough stone of the Mount of Olives, His footprints glow faintly, etched into the rock as if permanently sanctified. The disciples stand in awe, their faces a mix of wonder and resolve, some reaching upward, others kneeling in prayer. The landscape stretches behind them—rolling hills, a distant Jerusalem—bathed in the soft light of dawn. Above, the heavens part, revealing a glimpse of celestial glory, with angels hovering in adoration. The composition balances earthly gravity and heavenly ascent, emphasizing both Christ's departure and His enduring presence."
