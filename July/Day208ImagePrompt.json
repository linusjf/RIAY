  "image_prompt": "A grand Baroque painting depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Trinity. The scene is bathed in celestial light, with God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit as a dove placing a golden crown upon Mary's head. She is radiant in richly detailed robes of deep blue and crimson, her expression serene yet exalted, surrounded by swirling clouds and adoring angels. The composition is dynamic, with dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, emphasizing the divine favor bestowed upon her. Below, hints of earthly realms fade into darkness, symbolizing her role as intercessor between heaven and humanity."
