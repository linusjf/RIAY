  "image_prompt": "A luminous Gothic cathedral scene depicting the Assumption of Mary. The Virgin, haloed in gold and draped in flowing white robes, rises on swirling azure clouds, carried by a host of angels with iridescent wings. Below, an empty tomb rests in a garden where two saints kneel in reverence. A group of disciples, their faces filled with awe, gaze upward amidst intricate stone tracery. Stained glass windows cast prismatic light across the scene, blending earthly and heavenly realms. The composition balances delicate details—folds of fabric, feather textures, carved foliage—with a grand sense of motion toward the celestial."
