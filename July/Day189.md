### AI-Generated Summary: The Humble Astonishment of the Annunciation

Consider, dear reader, the scene so tenderly rendered by Fra Angelico: a young maiden and a celestial messenger, each bowing in mutual reverence. Here is no spectacle of earthly power, but a quiet revolution—the moment the Infinite chose to dwell within the finite. Mary’s question, _“How can this be?”_ is not doubt, but the rightful wonder of a heart confronted with the impossible made possible by God.

Gabriel’s reply—_“Nothing is impossible with God”_—is the thread that stitches heaven to earth. In that fresco at San Marco, we see it: humility meeting grace, the divine condescension that bends low to lift us high. The Annunciation is not merely a past event, but an eternal truth—that God still enters the ordinary, if we, like Mary, have the courage to say _“Let it be.”_

And so the Incarnation begins, not with fanfare, but with a whisper, a surrender, a joy that would undo the world’s sorrow.
