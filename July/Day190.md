### AI-Generated Summary: The New Ark and the Song of Joy

Consider, dear reader, how Mary, bearing the Eternal Word within her, becomes the true Ark of the Covenant—not of stone and gold, but of flesh and devotion. As the Ark once carried the presence of God to Israel, so Mary carries Christ into the world, a living sanctuary.

In the Visitation, we see this mystery unfold with radiant simplicity. Mary, having received the angel’s tidings, hastens to Elizabeth, and at their meeting, joy overflows into poetry. Words alone could not suffice; the soul must sing. Thus, the Magnificat springs forth, not as mere speech, but as a hymn—proof that the deepest truths demand the elevation of song.

Here, too, we learn of Mary’s charity. St. Alphonsus reminds us that her journey to Elizabeth was no small act, but a labor of love, a mother’s kindness extended before she had yet held her own Child. And so, in our own need, we may rightly echo St. Mother Teresa’s plea: _"Mary, be a mother to me now."_ For she who bore the Savior does not cease to bear us to Him.
