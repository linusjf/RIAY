### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Commission and the Art of Witness

Behold Duccio’s _Appearance on the Mountain in Galilee_, where the risen Christ, clad in crimson and blue, stands upon a golden hill, His hands aloft in blessing and command. The apostles, each face a story of awe, gather on the rough slope below—youth beside elder, all knit by wonder. Here is Byzantium’s glory softened by Gothic tenderness, a meeting of heaven’s gold and earth’s muted tones. The mountain, though stylized, hints at depth, as if the very ground strains to bear the weight of this moment: the Master’s charge to carry His word to all nations.

Yet the painting is but a shadow of the truth it points to—that every believer, then and now, is called to the same sacred work. To know Christ is to make Him known; to love Him is to speak of Him. When last did your lips shape His name for another’s sake? To the lapsed, the weary, the doubting? Take heart: the same Lord who stood on that mountain walks with you still, His presence your courage, His Spirit your words. Pray for the readiness of a disciple, that when the moment comes, you may say, like Peter, _"Lord, You know I love You,"_ and go.
