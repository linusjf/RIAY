### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Gift and the Art of Waiting

Consider, dear reader, how the world prizes power seized by force—the clenched fist, the towering edifice, the self-made triumph. Yet Heaven’s economy operates otherwise. True power descends as a gift, like the tongues of flame at Pentecost, alighting only on those who wait with open hands. Simone Peterzano’s _Pentecost_ captures this mystery: the Virgin, still and expectant, bathed in golden light; the disciples, their faces upturned as the Dove’s radiance pierces the dark. Here is Mannerist drama indeed—not of human striving, but divine generosity.

Lent teaches us to labor; Easter, to receive. The world clamors for control, but the Christian kneels, knowing that every true strength—like those painted flames above each head—comes not by our cunning, but by grace. To wait is not idleness; it is the soul’s posture before the Giver of all good things.
