    "image_prompt": "A sequential, stylized illustration in the vein of Studio Ghibli concept art, depicting five sorrowful scenes with deep emotional resonance. First, a solitary figure kneels in agonized prayer in a moonlit garden, face anguished but resolved. Second, the same figure is bound to a stone pillar, back torn by scourges under the cold light of a pragmatic courtyard. Third, rough hands press a crown of sharp thorns upon his head, a brutal parody of royalty. Fourth, the figure struggles up a hill, bearing the immense, weathered timber of a cross. Fifth, on the hill of Calvary, love is crucified under a darkened sky, the scene imbued with a profound, silent finality. All human forms are anatomically correct with clearly visible, expressive faces and hands."
