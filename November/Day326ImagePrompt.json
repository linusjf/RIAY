    "image_prompt": "A deeply evocative, stylized illustration in the manner of Loish or Studio Ghibli concept art, depicting the central theme of bearing a weight in a garden. A solitary, luminous figure kneels in a dark, somber garden, their posture conveying immense spiritual burden and sorrow. An angel with softly glowing wings descends, offering strength, its presence creating a pool of ethereal light amidst the gnarled olive trees. The figure's hands, anatomically correct with five distinct fingers, are clasped in prayer, face upturned with a expression of profound, human anguish and divine acceptance. The scene is rendered with rich, emotional color and dramatic lighting, focusing on the intimate, terrible struggle and the comfort offered."
