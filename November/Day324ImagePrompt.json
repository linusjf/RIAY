  "image_prompt": "A stylized concept art illustration showing five interconnected scenes representing the Joyful Mysteries. In the center, the Annunciation features a humble maiden in a sunlit room receiving a divine messenger, her face showing serene acceptance. To the right, two women embrace in a hill country landscape, one visibly pregnant, with a sense of sacred recognition between them. Below, a nativity scene shows a newborn in a simple feeding trough adored by rough-clothed shepherds under a starry sky. An elderly man carefully holds an infant in a grand temple setting, his face illuminated with fulfillment. Finally, a young boy sits among wise teachers, gesturing thoughtfully as his anxious parents approach. The composition flows with warm golden light connecting all scenes, rendered in the detailed yet expressive style of Studio Ghibli with Loish's emotional character expressions and Glen Keane's graceful linework, maintaining perfect anatomical proportions in all human figures with clearly visible, naturally posed hands and expressive faces."
