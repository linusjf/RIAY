### AI-Generated Summary: On the Moment When Eternity Bent Low and a Virgin Bore the Infinite

My dear reader, imagine, if you will, a quiet that was about to be shattered by a music the world had not yet heard. Into the ordinary dwelling of a maiden in Nazareth came a messenger, not with the clamour of earthly kings, but with the terrible and beautiful silence of Heaven’s own purpose. The angel’s greeting was itself a revolution—a declaration that this young woman was already brimming with a gift she did not herself comprehend, a grace that made her the focal point of all history.

She was, as any of us would be, troubled by this unlooked-for glory. Yet the word came to her, as it so often must come to us: “Do not be afraid.” The announcement that followed was the hinge upon which the universe turns—that she would bear a Son, whose name is salvation, and whose reign would have no end. With a humility that is the very substance of courage, she questioned not in disbelief, but with the quiet reason of a soul weighing the most tremendous of proposals. The explanation was given: the Holy Spirit would accomplish what nature could not, and the child would be holy.

And then, the moment of consent. In those few words, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord,” a door was opened between the timeless and time, and the Divine Life entered the stream of our mortal affairs. It is a picture, is it not, of every human soul presented with a task from God—the fear, the questioning, and the ultimate, freely given “yes” that allows the work to begin. This first Joyful Mystery is followed by others—the Visitation, the Nativity, the Presentation, and the Finding in the Temple—each a further unfolding of that first, glorious acquiescence, whereby joy itself entered the world in the form of a child.
