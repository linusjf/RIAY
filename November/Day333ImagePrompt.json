    "image_prompt": "A stylized concept art illustration showing five brilliant windows floating in a celestial space, each window revealing a different luminous mystery scene: Christ's baptism in the Jordan River with heavens opening, the wedding at Cana with water transforming into wine, Christ preaching the Kingdom with diverse listeners, the Transfiguration on a mountain with radiant divine light, and the Last Supper with bread and wine glowing with spiritual significance. The composition features flowing divine light connecting all windows, influenced by Studio Ghibli's ethereal style with anatomically faithful figures showing natural postures and clearly visible hands with five distinct fingers each."
