    "image_prompt": "A stylized, majestic illustration of the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven. She is a central figure with a serene and anatomically correct face, raised hands with five distinct fingers each in a gesture of grace. She is clothed with the sun, which radiates golden light around her form, and stands upon a crescent moon. A magnificent crown of twelve brilliant stars rests upon her head. The background is a deep, celestial blue filled with swirling nebulae and distant stars, creating a sense of divine glory and eternal reign. The art style is reminiscent of rich, luminous concept art, blending the ethereal quality of Studio Ghibli with the expressive linework of artists like Loish."
