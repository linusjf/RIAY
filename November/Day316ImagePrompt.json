    "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration in the manner of Loish or Studio Ghibli, depicting three key scenes from the Joyful Mysteries. Left panel: A young woman in a sunlit room, a divine messenger before her, her face serene yet resolute as golden light pours through a window. Center panel: Two women embracing in a lush hill country landscape, one with a visible pregnancy, the other's hand resting on her belly as a subtle, joyful light emanates from their meeting. Right panel: A quiet, humble stable at night, a radiant infant in a manger surrounded by adoring shepherds and animals, with a starry sky above illuminating the scene in soft blues and warm golds. All figures have natural, expressive postures and anatomically correct hands and faces, with a cohesive perspective linking the three moments in a flowing narrative."
