    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized religious illustration depicting five luminous signposts ascending through celestial clouds towards a radiant heavenly city. The first signpost shows an empty tomb with burial cloths; the second shows Christ ascending on a mount with disciples below; the third features descending tongues of fire over gathered figures; the fourth shows the Virgin Mary being assumed bodily into light; the fifth shows her coronation by the Holy Trinity amidst a heavenly host. The composition flows upward with divine light, influenced by the ethereal beauty of Studio Ghibli's skies and Glen Keane's expressive figure work, maintaining perfect perspective and anatomical correctness in all visible faces and hands."
