    "image_prompt": "A majestic, stylized religious illustration depicting five radiant points of light ascending in a celestial spiral. The sequence begins with a shattered tomb at the bottom, transitions through a figure ascending into clouds, then a descent of fiery tongues, a woman being assumed body and soul into a golden heaven, and culminates at the top with a crowned queen enthroned among stars, reigning over all creation. The style is reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts and Studio Ghibli's epic fantasy art, with rich colors, flowing lines, and anatomically precise figures with clearly visible, expressive faces and hands."
