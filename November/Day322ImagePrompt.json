    "image_prompt": "A stylized, emotionally resonant triptych illustration depicting the five sorrows of redemption in a continuous narrative. The scene flows from left to right: in a dark garden, a solitary figure kneels in anguished prayer, sweat like blood on his brow, with three disciples sleeping nearby. This transitions to a figure being scourged at a pillar, then crowned with thorns by mocking shadows. The central figure carries a heavy cross up a path, back bent under the weight, face determined. The sequence culminates in a crucifixion on a hill under an eclipsed sun, conveying profound sacrifice. The art style evokes the emotional depth and flowing lines of Loish or Glen Keane, with careful anatomical accuracy in hands and postures, rich symbolic color palettes, and seamless spatial transitions between each sorrow."
