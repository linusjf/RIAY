    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized religious illustration depicting the five Glorious Mysteries as sequential divine events. In the foreground, Christ emerges from a tomb with brilliant golden light, shattering stone and darkness. Above, He ascends towards heaven on a cloud, surrounded by angels, with outstretched hands drawing human figures upward. Below, the Holy Spirit descends as tongues of fire upon gathered disciples, illuminating their faces with divine wisdom. To the side, the Virgin Mary is assumed bodily into celestial glory, surrounded by swirling clouds and angelic hosts. At the pinnacle, she is crowned Queen by Christ in a majestic heavenly court, with stars and galaxies forming her mantle. The composition flows vertically with perfect perspective, showing the progression from earthly resurrection to heavenly coronation, rendered in the luminous, expressive style of Renaissance frescoes with vibrant colors and ethereal lighting."
