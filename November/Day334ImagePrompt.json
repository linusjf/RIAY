    "image_prompt": "A Northern Renaissance-style diptych illustrating the Five Sorrowful Mysteries in meticulous detail, rendered in the style of Jan van Eyck circa 1430. The left panel shows Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane under a starry night, His face in profound agony as He accepts the chalice. The central panel depicts the Scourging at the Pillar with Roman soldiers wielding whips against Christ's torn back, followed by the Crowning with Thorns where soldiers mockingly press a brutal thorn circlet upon His brow. The right panel portrays the Carrying of the Cross with Christ stumbling under the heavy wooden beam, culminating in the Crucifixion on Golgotha where His Mother Mary, John the Beloved, and Mary Magdalene grieve at the foot of the cross. The composition features van Eyck's characteristic luminous oil glazes, intricate detail, rich jewel-toned colors, and divine light illuminating the sacred scenes against a detailed landscape background with medieval architecture."
