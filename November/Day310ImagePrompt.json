    "image_prompt": "A deeply moving, stylized religious illustration depicting five sequential scenes in a continuous garden-to-calvary landscape. In the first scene, a divine figure kneels in anguished prayer under ancient olive trees, an angel comforting him while disciples sleep nearby. The second scene shows the same figure bound to a pillar, enduring a scourging with solemn dignity. The third presents him crowned with vicious thorns, robed in mock purple as soldiers jeer. The fourth captures his agonizing ascent up a steep path, bearing a massive wooden cross. The final scene reveals the ultimate sacrifice on a hilltop crucifixion, with a torn temple veil visible in the distance. The art style combines the emotional intensity of William Blake with the spiritual gravity of traditional iconography, using dramatic lighting and rich color to convey both human suffering and divine purpose."
