  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed stylized illustration in the manner of Loish and Studio Ghibli, showing five interconnected scenes representing the Glorious Mysteries. At center left, Christ emerges radiantly from a shattered tomb as Roman guards recoil in awe. Above, the Ascension shows Christ ascending into heavenly clouds while disciples gaze upward with wonder. To the right, the Holy Spirit descends as rushing wind and tongues of fire over gathered figures. Below, the Assumption depicts Mary being borne upward by angels from a tomb blooming with lilies as apostles watch in amazement. At center right, the Coronation shows the Holy Trinity placing a crown upon Mary's head as she sits enthroned amid celestial glory. All figures display anatomically correct faces and hands with expressive, natural postures, connected by flowing golden light that weaves through all five mysteries in perfect spatial harmony."
