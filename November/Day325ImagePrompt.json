    "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration depicting five key moments from the Luminous Mysteries. On the left, Christ stands in the Jordan River with the Holy Spirit descending as a dove. In the center, the Transfiguration shows Christ radiating brilliant light on a mountain peak with Moses and Elijah beside him. On the right, the Institution of the Eucharist features Christ offering bread in the Upper Room. The composition flows geometrically from water to mountain to sacred meal, with golden light connecting all scenes in the style of Loish's fluid linework and Glen Keane's expressive character design, maintaining perfect anatomical proportions in all human figures."
