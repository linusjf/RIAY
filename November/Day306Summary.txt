### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Profound Sorrows Which the Lord Endured for the Redemption of a Fallen World

My dear reader, let us consider the five great Sorrows, not as a mere recitation of ancient woes, but as a map of that terrible and loving descent whereby the King entered the deepest vaults of His own creation to win it back.

The first mystery finds Him in a garden, a place where the first rebellion was sown, now made the scene of a perfect submission. Here, the weight of the world’s sin presses upon His soul with such force that His sweat becomes as drops of blood, and He asks that this cup might pass—yet, not His will, but the Father’s, be done. All the while, His friends slumber, and a solitary angel ministers to Him in His agony.

The second mystery presents Him bound to a pillar, the Just for the unjust. Having been declared innocent by the governor’s own mouth, He submits His back to the scourges of the soldiers, taking upon His own flesh the stripes that our own waywardness has merited.

Then comes the third, a dreadful parody of kingship. They press a crown of thorns upon His brow, clothe Him in purple mockery, and offer a reed for a sceptre. “Hail, King of the Jews!” they cry, spitting upon and striking the very face that shaped the sun and stars. Thus, the true royalty of Heaven is revealed in the patience with which He bears this blasphemous scorn.

The fourth mystery shows Him carrying the instrument of His own execution. Weakened by loss of blood, He falls beneath the weight of the Cross, yet rises again and again to continue the journey. On that sorrowful road, He meets His mother, whose soul is pierced by a sword as was foretold, and accepts the aid of a stranger, Simon, who is compelled to share the burden.

Finally, upon the hill of Golgotha, the fifth mystery is consummated. He is nailed to the wood and lifted up between two thieves. From that throne of suffering, He speaks words of forgiveness, bestows His mother upon the beloved disciple, and endures the ultimate loneliness of dereliction. Then, with a final cry of “It is finished,” He surrenders His spirit, and the great veil of the Temple is torn from top to bottom, for the way is now open.
