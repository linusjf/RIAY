    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized religious illustration depicting five interconnected scenes in a continuous narrative. The first shows the Resurrection at dawn: an angel with a countenance like lightning and raiment white as snow stands before an open tomb, with Roman guards struck down like dead men, while two Marys witness the empty burial cloths. The second scene portrays the Ascension: Christ rising in blessing amid a luminous cloud, with His mother and disciples watching below as two heavenly messengers appear. The third suggests the Holy Spirit's descent as tongues of fire over gathered figures. The fourth shows the Assumption of Mary, her body glowing as she's raised to heaven. The final scene presents her Coronation as Queen of Heaven, crowned by the Trinity. The composition maintains perfect perspective with anatomically correct figures, clearly visible faces expressing awe and reverence, and hands with five distinct fingers in natural postures of worship and blessing. The style blends the luminous quality of Renaissance frescoes with the expressive linework of sacred iconography."
