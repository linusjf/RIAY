    "caption": "In the lonely garden, Christ bore the world's sorrow while his disciples slept nearby.",
    "image_prompt": "A dramatic, emotionally charged illustration of Christ kneeling in prayer at Gethsemane, his face anguished yet resolute as he looks heavenward. Beads of sweat like blood fall upon the dark soil between olive tree roots. Three disciples lie sleeping in the foreground, their forms partially obscured by shadows cast from a single divine light source breaking through the gnarled branches. The composition emphasizes Christ's profound isolation despite the nearby presence of his followers, with a celestial glow hinting at the strengthening angel mentioned in scripture. Style reminiscent of classical biblical artwork with strong chiaroscuro lighting and rich, somber color palette."
