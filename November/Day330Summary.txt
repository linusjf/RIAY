### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Profound Sorrows Endured in the Garden and the Courtyard and Upon the Hill

My dear reader, we are invited to contemplate a series of five profound sorrows, a descent into the very heart of anguish undertaken willingly for our sake. The first finds a solitary figure in a moonlit garden, bowed not by the weight of sleep which had overcome his companions, but by the crushing weight of a world’s sin, and in that agony, He speaks the words that undo the rebellion of Eden: “Not my will, but Thine.” From that garden of prayer, we are taken to the cold pragmatism of the state, to the pillar where He was bound and scourged, His flesh torn by the calculated cruelty of the law.

Then comes a darker mockery still, as rough hands press a crown of thorns upon the King of all Creation, a brutal parody of royalty offered in scorn to the one who is Truth itself. Bearing the instrument of this final humiliation, He then takes up the Cross, that heavy timber which was, in a mystery, the true weight of every betrayal and every lie ever told, and carries it up the hill. And this sorrowful road finds its end, and its purpose, upon the hill of Calvary, in the fifth mystery—the Crucifixion—where Love Himself consented to be nailed fast, and in that great silence, finished His work.
