    "image_prompt": "A stylized, emotionally charged illustration in the vein of Studio Ghibli's poignant moments, depicting a solitary man kneeling in a moonlit garden of gnarled olive trees. His posture is one of profound surrender and anguish, head bowed, with anatomically correct hands clasped in prayer. A celestial, ethereal angel descends, bringing a soft, comforting light that contrasts with the surrounding darkness. The scene is rendered with deep shadows and a sorrowful, yet serene atmosphere, capturing the moment of ultimate acceptance before the ensuing passion."
