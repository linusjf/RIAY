### AI-Generated Summary: The First Light Shown at the Jordan and the Mysteries That Followed

It is a curious thing that the Divine chose to begin His public work not with a king's pronouncement, but in the humble waters of the Jordan, standing shoulder to shoulder with the very sinners He came to save. There, as He emerged, the heavens themselves were torn open, and the great secret was whispered for all who had ears to hear: the Spirit, like a dove, descended, and the voice of the Father declared, "This is my beloved Son." Here, in one moment, we see the Trinity unveiled and the waters of all our baptisms made holy by His touch.

And this first great Light was but the beginning. It was followed by the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, a sign that the old order of mere law was to be transfigured into the new wine of grace. Then came the proclamation of the Kingdom, a call for every soul to turn from its shadowed paths and toward the sun. Next, on the high mountain, His face shone like the sun and His clothes became white as light, a fleeting glimpse of the glory that awaits all who are His. Finally, He gave us the most intimate of gifts: His very self in the form of bread and wine, the Institution of the Eucharist, so that we might never be without His substantial presence on our long journey home.
