  "image_prompt": "A stylized concept art illustration showing a winding spiritual path illuminated by five distinct glowing lanterns suspended in air. The first lantern shows Christ kneeling in river waters with heavens opening above. The second reveals water transforming into rich red wine at a wedding feast. The third depicts a radiant figure preaching to diverse crowds with healing hands. The fourth shows a transfigured figure glowing with celestial light between Moses and Elijah. The fifth lantern illuminates a simple upper room where bread and wine glow with inner divine light. The path transitions from riverbanks through villages and mountains to an intimate chamber, all rendered in the lyrical style of Studio Ghibli with soft lighting and atmospheric perspective."
