### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Great Sorrow and the Four That Followed in the Garden of Our Redemption

My dear reader, we are invited to consider the first of the Sorrowful Mysteries, where we find a Man in a garden, quite alone in the dark. This is no ordinary garden, but the place where a profound and terrible sorrow fell upon Him. He asked, as any man would, that the cup of suffering might pass, yet He bowed His head and spoke the words that undo the rebellion of Eden: not my will, but Yours. And in that moment of perfect surrender, a strength not of this world was sent to Him, an angel to comfort a Man as He prepared to drink the cup for the sake of all.

Then follow the four great sorrows that complete this terrible and glorious procession. The second mystery shows us the Scourging at the Pillar, a brutal rending of flesh. The third presents the Crowning with Thorns, a cruel mockery of a kingship the world cannot understand. The fourth is the Carrying of the Cross, that long, weary journey under the weight of the instrument of His death. And the fifth, the final mystery, is the Crucifixion itself—the consummation of love’s labour, where Life Himself died so that we might live.
