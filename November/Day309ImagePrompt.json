    "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration depicting five sequential scenes in a cohesive, flowing composition. From left to right: Christ standing in the River Jordan with the Holy Spirit descending as a dove; the wedding at Cana with water transforming into wine in visible stone jars; Christ preaching on a mountainside with diverse listeners gathered; the Transfiguration showing Christ radiant with Moses and Elijah on a high mountain; and the Upper Room with Christ instituting the Eucharist surrounded by apostles. The art style combines elements of Loish's fluid linework and Studio Ghibli's luminous color palette, with careful anatomical proportions in all human figures and natural, expressive hand gestures throughout. A golden thread of divine light connects all five scenes, symbolizing the path of redemption."
