  "image_prompt": "A stylized religious illustration showing five radiant points of light arranged in an arc across a celestial landscape, each glowing sphere containing a miniature scene from the Luminous Mysteries: Christ's baptism in the Jordan River with a dove descending, the wedding at Cana with water transforming into wine, Christ preaching on a mountainside to gathered followers, the Transfiguration with brilliant light emanating from Christ's figure, and the Last Supper with apostles gathered around a table. The artwork features soft golden illumination, ethereal blues, and warm earth tones in the style of illuminated manuscripts with delicate linework and subtle gilding effects, creating a cohesive spiritual narrative across all five mystical events."
