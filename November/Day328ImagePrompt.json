    "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscripts and Studio Ghibli's delicate artistry, depicting five sequential scenes of the Joyful Mysteries. The Annunciation shows a humble maiden in a sunlit room receiving a celestial messenger with golden light. The Visitation portrays two women embracing in a garden, one with a barely visible divine glow. The Nativity centers on a rustic stable with animals surrounding a feeding-trough cradle illuminated by starlight. The Presentation reveals an ancient temple where an old man recognizes something extraordinary in an ordinary child. The Finding shows a remarkable boy teaching wise elders in temple corridors, his understanding surpassing theirs. All scenes maintain perfect perspective and anatomical accuracy, with expressive faces and detailed hands, connected by flowing decorative borders of vines and celestial patterns."
