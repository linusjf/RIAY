### AI-Generated Summary: The First Profound Sorrow and the Four That Follow in the Garden of Our Redemption

My dear reader, let us consider this first mystery, where we find the Divine Son in a garden, a place which should speak of innocence, yet now bears the terrible weight of a sorrow so profound that it pressed from His pores not mere sweat, but great drops of blood. Here He knelt, fully God and fully Man, and in that human nature He asked if this cup might pass, yet surrendered His will completely to the Father’s. And while an angel was sent to strengthen Him, His own disciples slept, a picture of how we so often slumber through the world’s great agonies.

The second mystery, the Scourging at the Pillar, shows us the Word made flesh submitting His back to the lash, taking upon Himself the stripes of our own waywardness and sin. In the third, the Crowning with Thorns, the King of Kings is given a mocking diadem, the sharp points a bitter homage to our cruel thoughts and the false crowns we fashion in our pride. The fourth, the Carrying of the Cross, finds Him bearing the instrument of His own execution up the hill, a burden we are each invited to share with Him in our own trials. And finally, the fifth mystery, the Crucifixion, where Love Himself is nailed to the tree, the ultimate surrender that tears the veil and opens a way we could not make for ourselves.
