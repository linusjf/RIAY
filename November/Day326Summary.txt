### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Sorrowful Mysteries and the Weight Borne in a Garden

My dear reader, let us consider the five Sorrowful Mysteries, which are not merely a sequence of events but a descent into the very heart of what it cost.

The first mystery finds a Man in a garden, a place that should have been a second Eden, but was instead the place where all our sorrows were laid upon a single shoulder. There, in Gethsemane, He was overcome with a dread so profound that His very sweat became as drops of blood, a most intimate and terrible sign of His struggle. And in that moment of supreme loneliness, an angel was sent to strengthen Him for the cup He had chosen to drink, a cup not of His own making, but of ours.

The second mystery is the Scourging at the Pillar, where the flesh of the Creator was torn by the hands of those He created, a brutal and bloody prelude to the greater suffering that was to come.

The third is the Crowning with Thorns, a cruel mockery of a kingdom, where a plaited crown was pressed upon the brow of Him who wears the eternal crown of heaven, a jest of the damned upon the King of Kings.

In the fourth mystery, He takes up the Cross. Weakened and broken, He bears the rough wood through the streets, a spectacle for the crowd. He falls, He rises, and on that path He meets His mother, whose soul was pierced as surely as by a sword. A woman named Veronica steps from the throng to offer a small kindness, wiping His face, and receiving in return a miraculous image of His sacred countenance—a lasting testament to the truth that no act of love, however small, is ever lost.

And the final mystery is the Crucifixion itself, the culmination of all that went before. Upon the hill of Calvary, between heaven and earth, the Lamb was slain, and the door that had been shut since the first garden was at last flung open.
