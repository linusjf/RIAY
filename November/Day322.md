### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Great Sorrow and the Four That Follow in the Terrible Sequence of Our Redemption

My dear reader, let us consider that moment in the quiet of the garden, where a weight was laid upon a single human soul such as the world had never borne. There, amidst the olives, the Master entered into a sorrow so profound that it pressed from Him a sweat of blood, and He asked, as any man would, that the cup might pass. Yet He spoke the words that untie the knot of our own wilfulness: not my will, but Thine. An angel was sent to strengthen Him for a task that angels could not comprehend, while His friends, whom He had asked to watch, slept—a picture, I daresay, of how we so often slumber through the crises of those we love.

This was but the first of five great sorrows. The second, the Scourging, shows us the Word through whom all flesh was made, submitting His own flesh to the whip for the healing of our own waywardness. The third, the Crowning with Thorns, reveals the mockery of all worldly kingship, as the true King wears a crown that pierces, accepting the world’s sneer as His sceptre. The fourth, the Carrying of the Cross, is the long, patient journey under a weight that was not His own, a picture of every burden borne out of love. And the last, the Crucifixion, is the finality of the gift, where Life Himself died, and the sun hid its face, because the thing was too terrible and too wonderful to look upon.
