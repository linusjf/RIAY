    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, luminous triptych-style illustration depicting five key moments from Christ's early ministry. From left to right: 1) Jesus standing in the Jordan River, water streaming from His shoulders as a dove descends through parted clouds onto His head, with a beam of heavenly light illuminating the scene. 2) The wedding at Cana showing Jesus gesturing toward stone water jars as water transforms into deep red wine. 3) Jesus preaching on a hillside to a diverse crowd with expressive, attentive faces. 4) The Transfiguration on a mountain peak, with Jesus radiating golden light, His face shining like the sun and robes glowing white, flanked by Moses and Elijah. 5) The Last Supper showing Jesus offering bread to disciples with reverent, detailed hands. All scenes maintain consistent lighting from a divine source, with natural postures and anatomically correct figures in the style of sacred Renaissance art mixed with modern biblical illustration."
