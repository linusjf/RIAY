### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Two Glorious Mysteries and the Three That Follow

My dear reader, let us consider these five great signposts, though only the first two are described for our present contemplation. The first, the Resurrection, presents itself not with a quiet creeping but with a great shaking of the earth. At dawn, the two Marys find the tomb not sealed, but opened by an angel whose dreadful splendour—a countenance like lightning and raiment white as snow—strikes the guards as dead men. To the women, however, he speaks a word that turns the universe inside out: “Do not be afraid.” He shows them the vacant tomb, a hollowed-out space where death itself has been defeated, and bids them carry this impossible news to the disciples. And as they go, charged with a strange alloy of fear and joy, He Himself meets them. They take hold of His feet, a solid and tangible truth, and worship Him. Here is the firstfruits, the new creation breaking in upon the old.

The second mystery, the Ascension, marks a fitting end that is really a beginning. Forty days after, in the company of His mother and His friends, He is taken up, blessing them as He goes, until a cloud, the very vehicle of the Divine Presence, receives Him. This is no disappearance, but a coronation. He returns to the Father, our human nature now enthroned at the right hand of God, there to plead our cause. And as the disciples stand gazing upward, two heavenly messengers declare this same Jesus will return as He departed. We are thus reminded that our true country is not here, and our hearts must learn to seek it.

Of the three that follow—the Descent of the Holy Spirit, the Assumption, and the Coronation of Mary—we are given only the names. Yet even a name can be a window. The Spirit’s descent is the Comforter breathed upon the Church, the very life and fire of God in man. The Assumption is the happy lot of she who was full of grace, her body, the first sanctuary of the Lord, spared the corruption of the grave and taken into glory. And her Coronation shows us the final purpose of our race: that a creature, lowly and obedient, should be crowned Queen of Heaven and Earth, sharing in the authority of her Son. In these, we see the pattern of our own hope.
