### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Great Luminous Mysteries Which Illuminate the Path from the River Jordan to the Upper Room - Day 321

My dear reader, we are invited to consider these five Luminous Mysteries not as mere events of history, but as great lamps lit along the path, each casting its own particular and necessary light upon the nature of things.

The first, His Baptism in the Jordan, shows us the King kneeling in the water, the heavens torn open, and the Voice declaring a Sonship that was from the beginning, thus hallowing all waters and the flesh they signify.

The second, the Wedding at Cana, reveals that the same Power which spins the galaxies does not disdain the small, real troubles of men; the water of our ordinary joys is changed, at a mother’s plea, into the wine of a divine and heady joy.

The third, the Proclamation of the Kingdom, is that clarion call which echoes still through the world’s noise—a summons to turn, to believe, and to see that the long-awaited Rule is not of armies and thrones, but of a Love that heals the sick and confounds the wise with simple tales.

Then comes the Transfiguration, a sudden rent in the curtain of this world, where the light of a different country shines through His very skin. The Law and the Prophers bear witness to Him, and the command from the cloud is the only command that matters: “Listen to Him.”

And finally, in the quiet of the Upper Room, we are brought to the most profound and homely of miracles. Here, in the simple, solid things of bread and wine, the Maker of all things gives Himself utterly, planting eternity in the midst of time and making a new and everlasting covenant from the stuff of our daily table.
