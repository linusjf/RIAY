    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized concept art illustration depicting the Five Glorious Mysteries as a unified celestial vision. In the center, Christ rises from an empty tomb with radiant light, his hands showing five distinct fingers as he blesses the viewer. Above, he ascends into clouds surrounded by angels, while below, the Holy Spirit descends as tongues of fire upon the apostles in the Upper Room. To the right, the Virgin Mary is assumed bodily into heaven, her posture graceful and natural, while above her, Christ crowns her as Queen of Heaven, both figures with anatomically faithful faces expressing divine joy. The composition maintains perfect spatial coherence with heavenly gold light connecting all five mysteries in a harmonious circular arrangement, influenced by the flowing lines and emotional depth of Studio Ghibli's spiritual imagery and Glen Keane's expressive character designs."
