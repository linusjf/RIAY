    "image_prompt": "A detailed, reverent illustration depicting the Annunciation in a humble dwelling in Nazareth. A young Virgin Mary, with a posture of humility and awe, looks upon the Archangel Gabriel, who appears with magnificent, softly glowing wings, emanating a divine light that illuminates the simple room. The scene is captured from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing the heavenly messenger's grandeur and Mary's profound yet courageous acceptance. The Holy Spirit is symbolized by a subtle, ethereal dove and rays of golden light, representing the moment the Divine entered time. The style is a masterful blend of Renaissance anatomical fidelity and the luminous, emotive quality of sacred art, with particular care given to the expressive, natural hands and faces of both figures."
