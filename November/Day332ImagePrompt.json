    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration depicting the Five Joyful Mysteries as five luminous pillars of light ascending through a dawn sky. Each pillar contains a symbolic scene: the Annunciation with an angel before a humble maiden, the Visitation showing two women embracing, the Nativity with a radiant manger, the Presentation in a grand temple, and the Finding showing a boy teaching among elders. The composition flows vertically with warm, golden light, influenced by the sacred art of Fra Angelico and the lyrical clarity of Studio Ghibli, creating a harmonious and spiritually uplifting narrative sequence."
