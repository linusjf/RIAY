    "image_prompt": "A deeply moving, stylized religious illustration depicting the five sorrows of Christ as a unified narrative. The composition shows Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane sweating blood with a sleeping disciple in the foreground, transitioning to His scourging at the pillar with Roman soldiers wielding whips, then the crowning with thorns where figures mock Him with a reed scepter, followed by Him carrying the cross while meeting His mother with compassionate eye contact, and finally the crucifixion on Golgotha between two thieves with the temple veil tearing in the background. The art style evokes sacred Renaissance art with anatomical precision in Christ's suffering form, clearly visible hands with five distinct fingers, and a cohesive color palette of deep crimsons and golds unifying the scenes. The perspective draws the viewer through each sorrow sequentially, emphasizing both human agony and divine purpose."
