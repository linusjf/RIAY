### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Great Luminous Mysteries Which Illuminate the Path of Faith

My dear reader, one finds in these mysteries not a mere sequence of events, but a dawning light, a series of brilliant windows through which the Divine Life streams into our own shadowed world. First, at the River Jordan, the heavens were torn open and the Voice from beyond all worlds declared the Man in the water to be the beloved Son, hallowing the very waters of our own birth into Him. Then, at a wedding in Cana, at the quiet plea of His Mother, the common water of our daily toil was turned to the good wine of joy, a first and telling sign of a glory that serves our deepest needs.

He then strode into the world proclaiming a Kingdom that was at once at hand and yet to come, calling all men and women to a great turning-about of the heart, a metanoia, for the old order was passing away. And to a chosen few upon the high mountain, the veil of His humanity was drawn back for a moment, and they saw Him in the unborrowed light of His divinity, speaking with the Law and the Prophets, a preview of the glory that awaits all who are made new in Him. Finally, in the upper room, He performed the ultimate miracle of condensation, giving Himself—His very substance, His body and blood—under the humble forms of bread and wine, a perpetual fountain of divine life planted squarely in the midst of our created order, so that we might feed on Him and never hunger.
