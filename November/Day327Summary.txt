### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Glorious Signs Given to Mankind Concerning the Resurrection and What Followed Thereafter

My dear reader, let us consider together these five glorious signs, these windows into a deeper country, which the faithful contemplate in their prayers.

The first is the Resurrection itself, where the stone was rolled away not to let a prisoner out, but to let the world look in upon an empty tomb. An angel, dreadful in his splendour with a countenance like lightning and raiment white as snow, brought the news to the two Marys that the Lord was risen. And He Himself met them on the way, no phantom, but solid and real, commanding them to carry the word to His brethren.

The second is the Ascension, where on the slope near Bethany, the Master blessed His followers and was taken up, a cloud receiving Him out of their sight. And as they strained their eyes towards heaven, two men stood by them in white apparel, not to chide their gazing, but to promise that this same Jesus, in like manner, would one day return.

The third is the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. With a sound as of a rushing, mighty wind, and with tongues of fire resting upon each of them, the disciples were filled and their confusion of Babel was undone. They spoke, and men from every nation under heaven heard the wonders of God in their own tongues—a foretaste of a kingdom not of this world.

The fourth is the Assumption of Our Lady. As the old Ark of the Covenant was a shadow of heavenly things, so was she, the new Ark, taken up bodily into glory. The great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. Thus was the prophecy fulfilled that all generations would indeed call her blessed.

The fifth and final mystery is her Coronation. That same woman, seen by the seer, is hailed as Queen, arrayed in gold of Ophir. She is the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope, for from her sprang the Sun of Righteousness, and she now reigns with Him, a mother to the whole royal priesthood of believers.
