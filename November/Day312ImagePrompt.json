    "image_prompt": "A detailed fresco-style illustration depicting the Annunciation in a porticoed space, with the Virgin Mary turning gracefully towards the kneeling Archangel Gabriel, who has magnificent wings. A golden beam of light descends from heaven carrying the Holy Spirit as a dove, illuminating the scene with divine radiance. The architecture features classical elements with arched openings and stone textures. Mary's expression shows serene submission rather than fear, her hands positioned naturally in a gesture of acceptance. The composition follows Renaissance perspective principles with careful attention to spatial relationships between figures and environment, rendered in the delicate color palette and spiritual atmosphere reminiscent of Fra Angelico's works."
