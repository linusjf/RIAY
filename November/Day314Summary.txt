### AI-Generated Summary: On the Agony in the Garden and the Solitary Weight Borne for All Mankind

My dear reader, let us consider that moment in the garden, a place which became the first true threshold of that great sorrow. There, the Lord was withdrawn, weighed down by a dread so profound it pressed from Him a sweat as of blood, falling to the neglected ground. He asked, as any man might, that the cup be removed, yet He bowed His head to a will that was not His own. And while a messenger from heaven came to strengthen Him, His own friends, those He had brought to watch, were found sleeping, their spirits willing but their flesh proving weak. Here we see the loneliness of the Saviour, who took upon Himself the full terror of what was to come, and in His perfect surrender, transformed our own faltering submissions. The remaining mysteries of His Passion—the Scourging, the Crowning, the Carrying of the Cross, and the final Crucifixion—stand in solemn procession after this, each a deeper unfolding of that love which consented first amongst the olive trees.
