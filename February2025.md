### Rosary in a year Day 32

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

Joyful Mysteries
4\. The Presentation of the Lord Jesus in the Temple - Luke 2:22-39
Jesus is presented in the temple after 40 days of being born, as per the custom. Joseph and Mary offer turtledoves which was the sacrifice to be offered by poor people for purity. Mary, on account of her immaculate conception and virgin birth need not have offered the sacrifice, but humbly followed the law.
Simeon and Anna who belonged to the old Covenant were awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. They rejoice on seeing Jesus who will be the light of the world, thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah (42:6 and 49:6).

### Rosary in a Year Day 33

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

*Joyful Mysteries*
5\. The finding of Lord Jesus in the temple - Luke 2:41-52
Jesus, along with his parents, makes the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the feast of the passover. Though it was obligatory for Jewish boys to make the pilgrimage at the age of 13, Jesus accompanies his father Joseph at the age of 12 in preparation for the following year. Mary is faithful in accompanying her spouse and son. This teaches us that our life on earth is a pilgrimage, we are all walking in faith towards being more holy.
Jesus was lost and found in 3 days, which was an indication of Mary losing him at Mt. Calvary and getting him back in 3 days.
Jesus stays back at the temple to fulfil filial obedience. With the same obedience he surrendered himself on the cross, so we could share inner oneness with God.
