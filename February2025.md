### A Total Offering

[![A Total Offering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/February/jpgs/Day032.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CagK_uBu6LU "A Total Offering")

### Rosary in a year Day 32

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

Joyful Mysteries
4\. The Presentation of the Lord Jesus in the Temple - Luke 2:22-39
Jesus is presented in the temple after 40 days of being born, as per the custom. Joseph and Mary offer turtledoves which was the sacrifice to be offered by poor people for purity. Mary, on account of her immaculate conception and virgin birth need not have offered the sacrifice, but humbly followed the law.
Simeon and Anna who belonged to the old Covenant were awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. They rejoice on seeing Jesus who will be the light of the world, thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah (42:6 and 49:6).

### Lost and Found

### Rosary in a Year Day 33

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

_Joyful Mysteries_
5\. The finding of Lord Jesus in the temple - Luke 2:41-52
Jesus, along with his parents, makes the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the feast of the passover. Though it was obligatory for Jewish boys to make the pilgrimage at the age of 13, Jesus accompanies his father Joseph at the age of 12 in preparation for the following year. Mary is faithful in accompanying her spouse and son. This teaches us that our life on earth is a pilgrimage, we are all walking in faith towards being more holy.
Jesus was lost and found in 3 days, which was an indication of Mary losing him at Mt. Calvary and getting him back in 3 days.
Jesus stays back at the temple to fulfil filial obedience. With the same obedience he surrendered himself on the cross, so we could share inner oneness with God.

### RIAY Luminous Mysteries - Day 34

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

1. Baptism of Jesus Mathew 3:13-17

The mystery of the Holy Trinity is revealed as soon as Jesus is baptised at the Jordan. The Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, the Spirit of God, descends from heaven.
The river Jordan had a lot historic significance. It was the turning point for Joshua at the end of the Exodus. Prophet Elijah went up to heaven at the river Jordan, Prophet Elisha started his prophetic ministry at the river Jordan.

John's baptism was about beginning anew, reorienting one's life and preparing for the coming of the Messiah.
John through his baptism with water washed away sins and prepared the peoples' heart for the Messiah.
Jesus by dying on the cross, going to the tomb and resurrecting, washed away our sins to get us closer to His Father.

### Divine Bridegroom

[![Divine Bridegroom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/February/jpgs/Day035.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-jtqsyXYDwA "Divine Bridegroom")

### Rosary in a Year Day 35

Nadya Baracho
Goa, India

#### Luminous Mysteries

1. The wedding at Cana John 2:1-12
   Jesus performs his first miracle. Mary's words 'do whatever he says' are also her last in the scripture. These words should echo with us in our daily lives in every situation.
   Jesus performs the miracle on the 7th day of his ministry. The number 7 indicates perfection, completion.
   At the wedding there were 6 jars filled with water (6 days of creation). These are turned to wine (fulfillment with the sabbath). The 6 jars filled by human hands are going to be completed, fulfilled, turned into wine by Jesus.
   The wedding at Cana was the first among the 7 signs he perfomed. The other signs were healing of the official's son, healing of the paralytic, multiplying of loaves, healing of the blind man, raising lazarus from death and His ressurection.
   Jesus is the new wine. He is the new creation, the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus is the divine bridegroom. Just as the bridegroom rejoices over his bride (Isaiah 62:5), Jesus rejoices over us, His people. He is the bridegroom who laid down His life for His bride - the Church. Jesus is inviting us to be in an intimate relationship with Him.

3.The proclamation of the kingdom - The Kingdom and the Gospel. Mark 1:14-15.

### RIAY Day 38 Nadya Baracho

Luminous Mysteries
5\. The Institution of the Eucharist - Jesus tthe Bread of Life. Luke 22:14-23
Jesus institutes the new covenant at the last supper with his apostles. Just as the traditional passover revolved around the sacrifice of the lamb, the new passover revolves around the body and blood of Christ who was crucified for us. Jesus is the lamb of God who led us through the new Exodus from sin to freedom. He is the new manna which sustains us through our journey to the promised land. The bread blessed, broken and given becomes His flesh!
It is mandatory for us to eat his flesh to receive eternal life.
