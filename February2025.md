Joyful Mysteries
4\. The Presentation of the Lord Jesus in the Temple - Luke 2:22-39
Jesus is presented in the temple after 40 days of being born, as per the custom. Joseph and Mary offer turtledoves which was the sacrifice to be offered by poor people for purity. Mary, on account of her immaculate conception and virgin birth need not have offered the sacrifice, but humbly followed the law.
Simeon and Anna who belonged to the old Covenant were awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. They rejoice on seeing Jesus who will be the light of the world, thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah (42:6 and 49:6).
