### AI-Generated Summary: On the Finding in the Temple and Those First Great Shining Mysteries Wherein the Divine Light Broke Upon the World

It is a curious thing that we should find the Divine Boy not among the pots and pans of the kitchen, nor at play in the streets, but seated among the learned doctors in the Temple, both hearing them and asking questions. His mother’s gentle rebuke was met with that first mysterious declaration of a higher allegiance, a work that was His Father’s.

Then came the great Shining Mysteries, those moments when the Light Himself stepped from the quiet years into the public eye. First, in the waters of the Jordan, where the sinless One was baptized among sinners, and the voice of the Father thundered approval while the Spirit, in the form of a dove, descended. Next, at a wedding in Cana, where a mother’s quiet plea moved the Maker of the vine to turn water into wine, a plain hint of glory tucked into a domestic crisis. And then, the Proclamation: a call went out across the land for all to turn from their own ways and believe the Good News that the Kingdom of God, so long waited for, had at last drawn near.
