### AI-Generated Summary: On the Finding of the Child and the First Great Signs Which Illumined the World

My dear reader, we come first to that sorrowful and joyful discovery in the Temple, where the Boy was found after three days, not lost but about His Father’s business, confounding the learned doctors with His understanding. His mother, with a sword already in her heart, received that mysterious reply which she would treasure and ponder, a sign of the greater separation to come.

Then the light breaks forth, as from a door suddenly opened. At the Jordan, the heavens themselves were torn open, the Spirit descended like a dove, and the very Voice of the Father declared His pleasure in the Son, anointing Him for the work ahead.

Next, at the simple wedding in Cana, the failing wine spoke of a deeper poverty. At His mother’s bidding, the water in the great stone jars was transformed, not into mere drink, but into a sign of the new joy He brought, a first glimpse of His glory that stirred belief in the hearts of His followers.

And finally, the great Proclamation: the call to turn one’s very heart inside out, for the Kingdom was at hand. He taught the blessedness of the poor and the pure, He healed the sick and forgave the sinner, revealing a law of love that was not a burden but an invitation into the very life of God.
