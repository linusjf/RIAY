    "image_prompt": "A majestic and luminous coronation scene in the courts of heaven. The Virgin Mary, a woman of serene beauty and grace with a clearly visible, anatomically correct face and hands, is being crowned Queen of Heaven. The Holy Trinity is represented through a radiant, divine light from which three distinct beams emanate, symbolizing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, bestowing the crown. Mary is depicted in a posture of humble acceptance, her hands gently raised. She is surrounded by swirling clouds of gold and light, with countless angels and saints witnessing the event in awe. The style is a richly detailed, stylized illustration reminiscent of the luminous and expressive concept art of Studio Ghibli, with perfect perspective looking up towards the heavenly figures to emphasize their glory and majesty."
