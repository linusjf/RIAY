    "image_prompt": "A majestic yet tender scene of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, her body and soul being received into heavenly glory. She is depicted as a serene woman with a clearly visible, compassionate face and graceful hands, ascending amidst soft clouds and divine light. A delicate crown rests upon her head, signifying her as Queen of Heaven. Below, the small, awe-struck apostles look upward. The style is a stylized illustration reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's ethereal beauty and Glen Keane's expressive anatomy, with rich colors, flowing garments, and a profound sense of peace and divine promise."
