    "image_prompt": "A powerful diptych-style illustration contrasting two profound moments. On the left, a transfigured Christ stands radiant on a mountain peak, His face shining like the sun and garments glowing with pure light, conversing with the luminous figures of Moses and Elijah as the awestruck apostles Peter, James, and John look on from below. On the right, the same Christ is shown tied to a pillar, His back brutally torn by scourges, head bowed in agony, with Roman soldiers wielding whips in the shadowy courtyard. The composition emphasizes the paradox of the same sacred flesh—first glorified in divine light, then sacrificially wounded—unifying the scenes through a shared emotional intensity and masterful line work reminiscent of Loish's expressive, fluid style, with anatomically correct postures and clearly visible, detailed hands and faces in both suffering and awe."
