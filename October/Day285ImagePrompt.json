    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style composition showing three key biblical scenes in a harmonious layout. Left panel: A young boy with a radiant, wise expression teaching elders in the Jerusalem temple, surrounded by ancient scrolls and marble columns with morning light streaming through arched windows. Center panel: A serene adult figure standing in the Jordan River as a dove descends from golden clouds, with onlookers on the riverbank witnessing the sacred moment. Right panel: A wedding feast at Cana where stone water jars glow with transformed wine, with a figure quietly observing the miracle amid festive celebrations. The art style combines Renaissance composition with the luminous color palette and delicate linework of illuminated manuscripts, creating a cohesive narrative across all three scenes with accurate human proportions and natural postures."
