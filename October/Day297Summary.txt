### AI-Generated Summary: On the Profound Sorrows Which Preceded and the Glorious Dawn That Followed the Dark Night of the Soul

My dear reader, let us consider the final, terrible steps of the long road, where a crown was fashioned not of gold, but of thorn, and a purple robe was given in mockery to the one true King. We see him then, bent and broken, taking up the instrument of his own execution, falling beneath its dreadful weight, and meeting a mother’s gaze along that sorrowful way. At the summit of that hill, the nails were driven home; and there, from that cruel throne, he pardoned a thief, gave his mother to a son, and surrendered his spirit.

But this, you must understand, was not the end of the story. For on the third day, a stone was rolled away not by any hand but his own. Life Himself had entered the house of death and shattered it from within. The tomb stood empty, a silent witness to a victory so complete that it turned the mourning of his friends to a joy that would echo through all ages. This glorious truth is rendered with a solemn and geometric clarity in Piero della Francesca’s fresco, where a serene and mighty Christ, banner in hand, stands in tranquil triumph over the sleep of death, represented by the soldiers sprawled at his feet. It is a picture of a new world dawning, a permanent and unassailable peace.
