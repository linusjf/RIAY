### AI-Generated Summary: On the Final Glorious Steps Wherein Earth Meets Heaven in Triumph

My dear reader, consider the final acts of this great drama, which are not an ending but a proper beginning. The Son, his work finished, did not merely vanish but ascended—a man, body and soul, taking our humanity into the very heart of the divine, a pledge of our own future. Then came the rushing wind and the tongues of fire, not as a terror but as a comfort, clothing the small and frightened company with a power not their own, turning their confusion into a clarion call for a Church newly born. And what shall we say of the woman through whom He entered our world? It is a fitting and lovely truth that she, who was the first to bear Him, was the first to follow, assumed in her entirety into that glory, a promise to all flesh. Thus, she who said ‘yes’ to the divine plan is now crowned its Queen, not as a distant ruler, but as the most tender of mothers, interceding for her children with a love that now sees the face of the King.
