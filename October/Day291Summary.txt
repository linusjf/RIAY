### AI-Generated Summary: On the Mysteries That Illuminate the Dark Valley and the Suffering That Redeems

We are invited to consider four great turning points in the story that is the true history of the world. First comes the Transfiguration, that sudden rending of the veil, where for a moment the mortal frame of the Master could no longer contain the uncreated Light that He is, and the disciples saw, as we all shall one day see, the world lit by its proper light. From that mountain peak, we are led to the quiet of an upper room, where a greater mystery was enacted; for there, in the simple substances of bread and wine, He instituted the Eucharist, planting a new reality into the very fabric of this fallen world, a nourishment for pilgrims that is Himself.

Then the scene shifts, and the Light allows itself to be swallowed by the dark. We follow Him into the Garden of Gethsemane, where in His Agony we perceive no mere fear of death, but the full weight of the sin of the whole world pressing upon a single human heart, a dreadful cup that He freely consented to drink. And from that solitary anguish, we are taken to the public brutality of the Scourging, where the flesh of the Creator was torn by the hands of His creatures, a terrible picture of the cost of that forgiveness we so carelessly seek. In these things, we see the deep magic at work, where glory is won through sorrow, and life springs from a death willingly embraced.
