  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed scene inside a sun-drenched stone courtyard during a first-century wedding celebration at Cana. Jesus stands near six large stone water jars, his hand gently extended as clear water transforms into deep crimson wine being poured into a ceramic goblet. Mary watches nearby with knowing eyes while servants look on in astonished wonder. The atmosphere glows with warm afternoon light filtering through grapevines overhead, capturing the moment of divine miracle within an ordinary human celebration. The style blends biblical realism with subtle spiritual luminosity, reminiscent of sacred art traditions with accurate anatomy, natural postures, and clearly visible facial expressions conveying awe and revelation."
