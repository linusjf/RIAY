### AI-Generated Summary: On the Passage from Sorrow to Glory Through the Mysteries of the Rosary and the Union of Our Suffering with His

We find ourselves at that great turning of the way, where the sorrows of the King reach their dreadful summit and the glory that lies beyond all sorrows begins to dawn. First, consider that bitter mockery of the Crowning with Thorns, where soldiers, blind to the true royalty before them, clothed Him in purple and pressed that cruel circlet into His brow. Then follows that weary journey under the weight of the Wood, the Carrying of the Cross, a path trod not for His own sins but for ours. And upon the hill of Golgotha, the final mystery of sorrow is revealed in the Crucifixion, where nails and spear accomplished what Love had willed from the foundation of the world.

But this is not the end of the story, for the first Glorious Mystery, the Resurrection, breaks upon the world like a sudden sunrise after a long and terrible night. The tomb could not hold Him, and death itself is undone. Thus we are bidden to take our own small sufferings, our own private calvaries, and by an act of the will, unite them with His great Passion. In so doing, we find that our grief is transformed and taken up into that final, glorious victory which He has won for us.
