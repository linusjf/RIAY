    "caption": "The joyful mysteries remain as empty frames awaiting the vivid art of sacred imagination.",
    "image_prompt": "A stylized concept art illustration depicting four ornate, gilded picture frames hanging in a dim, reverent space. Each frame is empty except for a small brass plaque below it bearing the name of a Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Presentation. A soft, ethereal light spills from the empty frames, suggesting the profound spiritual events they represent, while the surrounding walls are bare stone, emphasizing the absence of detailed imagery. The style is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's atmospheric interiors, with a focus on light, shadow, and a feeling of serene anticipation."
