### AI-Generated Summary: On the Consolation of Heavenly Mysteries and the Repetition That Draws Us Nearer

My dear reader, you must not imagine that the value of these repeated prayers lies in their novelty, for we are not seeking new information as a man seeks news from foreign lands. Rather, we are like children who ask the same question of their father, not because they have forgotten the answer, but because they delight in the sound of his voice giving it. The mysteries themselves—the Ascension of our Lord, the fiery descent of the Spirit, the Assumption of His Mother into glory, and her Coronation as Queen—are not mere events to be studied, but realities to be inhabited. They are the very architecture of Heaven, shown to us in glimpses. The soul that perseveres in this humble repetition is not storing up words, but is rather being stored up _by_ them, turned gradually, through this patient exercise, toward the light. It is a training in attention, whereby the heart learns to prefer the substance of eternal things over the shifting shadows of our own cleverness.
