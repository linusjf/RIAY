    "image_prompt": "A majestic and stylized concept art illustration depicting five radiant signposts ascending through a celestial landscape. The first shows a brilliant doorway of light overcoming darkness; the second, a human figure ascending into a heavenly country; the third, a vibrant, living church ignited by rushing winds and tongues of fire; the fourth, a humble female figure being received body and soul into radiant glory; and the fifth, the same figure being crowned as a queen, her humility radiating as the true ruler of a vast, starry cosmos. The style is influenced by the luminous, flowing lines and profound emotional depth of Studio Ghibli, with anatomically correct figures, clear perspectives, and richly detailed, coherent scenery."
