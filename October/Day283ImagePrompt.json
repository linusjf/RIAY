    "image_prompt": "A majestic and luminous coronation scene in the heavenly court, where the resurrected Christ, depicted as the Lion of Judah in a stylized and powerful form reminiscent of Glen Keane's character designs, places a radiant crown upon the head of the Virgin Mary. She is shown as a humble yet glorious figure, her face serene and anatomically precise, her hands—each with five distinct fingers—folded in prayer or gently raised. A host of angels and saints witness the event amidst clouds of gold and light, their expressions filled with awe. The style is a blend of sacred iconography and dynamic concept art, with careful attention to spatial coherence, flowing garments, and a celestial perspective that emphasizes the divine honor bestowed upon humanity."
