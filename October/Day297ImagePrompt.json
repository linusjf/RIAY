    "image_prompt": "A fresco in the style of Piero della Francesca, depicting a serene and mighty Christ figure standing in tranquil triumph. He holds a banner, his posture calm and powerful, emerging from a classical tomb. The composition is geometrically precise and solemn. At his feet, soldiers in 15th-century Italian armor are sprawled in the deep sleep of death, their forms creating a dynamic contrast to his still, vertical presence. The lighting is clear and even, suggesting the dawn of a new world, with a landscape of rolling hills and architecture in the background, rendered with mathematical clarity and a palette of soft, earthy tones."
