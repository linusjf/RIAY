### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Great Signs That Crown Our Human Story with Divine Splendour

My dear reader, let us consider together these five great signposts, these Glorious Mysteries, which mark not an end but a coronation of our human story. First, we have the staggering truth of the Resurrection, where Death itself is unmasked and shown to be but a doorway. Then follows the Ascension, where our Lord, in His very humanity, is received back into the heavenly country, preparing a place for us. Next comes the Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, a rushing wind and tongues of fire that kindle cold hearts into a living Church. Then, as a foretaste of our own hope, the Blessed Virgin is assumed, body and soul, into gloryâ€”the creature fully received by the Creator. And finally, we behold her Coronation as Queen of Heaven and Earth, where humility is at last seen for what it truly is: the rightful ruler of all that is.
