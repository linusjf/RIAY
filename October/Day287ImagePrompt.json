    "image_prompt": "A highly detailed and dramatic illustration in the style of sacred Renaissance art, depicting the moment of resurrection as a cataclysm of hope. A brilliantly luminous figure strides forth from a shattered, empty tomb, with a stone rolled away. The figure's form is anatomically correct and radiates divine light, banishing the shadows of despair. The scene is one of profound reversal, where the chains of death and fear are visibly shattered by this formidable joy. The composition uses masterful perspective, drawing the eye from the dark, empty tomb to the triumphant, living figure, under a dawn sky that symbolizes a new beginning."
