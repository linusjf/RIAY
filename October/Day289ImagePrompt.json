    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration depicting the four Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary as a continuous, illuminated path. The scene flows from the Annunciation, with the Archangel Gabriel before a humble, luminous figure, to the Visitation showing two women embracing in a sun-drenched landscape where their meeting seems to radiate light. This transitions into the Nativity in a rustic, star-lit stable with a central focus on a manger, and finally to the Presentation in the Temple, where an elderly figure holds an infant aloft before an altar, with soft shadows hinting at future sorrow. The overall style is reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts and Studio Ghibli's ethereal beauty, with coherent perspective guiding the viewer's eye through the narrative sequence, rich in symbolic color and delicate details."
