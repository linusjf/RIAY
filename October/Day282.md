### AI-Generated Summary: On the Sorrowful Weight of Thorns and Wood and the Glorious Dawn That Follows

My dear reader, one must imagine the soldiers in the praetorium, not as monsters from a fable, but as ordinary men whose cruelty was the commonplace sort, who fashioned a crown from the bramble—that most unkingly diadem—and pressed it upon a brow that knew no sin. This is the third mystery: the Crowning with Thorns. Then follows the fourth, a spectacle of a different order, where the weight of the Cross is not merely that of timber, but of a world’s transgression borne up a narrow path. The fifth mystery is the thing itself: the Crucifixion, where the Love that made the worlds is nailed to the tree He made. Yet this is not the final word, for the first of the Glorious Mysteries shatters the silence of the tomb—the Resurrection—where Death itself begins to work backwards.
