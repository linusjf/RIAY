### AI-Generated Summary: On the Recitation of Mysteries

It may be observed by anyone who sets himself to this devotion that the rhythm of the prayer, which began at a pace suited to private contemplation, has now found a steadier and more corporate beat—the very cadence one might adopt when praying in common with the friars. It is a movement from the tentative steps of a novice toward the firm, measured tread of a pilgrim on a well-worn path.

The mysteries themselves, those windows into divine humility, were the first four Joyful ones. The Annunciation, where eternity broke into time and a young woman’s *fiat* changed the course of all things. The Visitation, where grace overflowed from one expectant mother to another, and sanctity leapt in the womb. The Nativity, where the Word became a crying infant laid in straw, the ultimate descent of Love into poverty. And finally, the Presentation, where the Child was brought to the Temple, and aged Simeon saw in that small bundle both the consolation of a people and the sword that would pierce a soul.

No images or carvings were described to fix these scenes before the inward eye; only the bare, glorious facts remain—which are, as we know, always enough.
