    "image_prompt": "A stylized religious illustration depicting a twelve-year-old Jesus seated among learned elders in the sunlit Jerusalem temple, gesturing thoughtfully as he explains scripture. His mother Mary and Joseph stand at the entrance, their faces showing a mixture of relief and astonishment, with architectural details of the temple creating a sense of sacred space. The style combines the luminous quality of Renaissance art with the expressive character design of biblical illustration, showing correct anatomy and perspective with clearly visible hands and faces."
