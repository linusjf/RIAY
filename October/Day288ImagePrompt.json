    "image_prompt": "A stylized concept art illustration depicting a soul as a translucent, humanoid figure being gradually turned towards a radiant, heavenly light source. The background shows architectural glimpses of heavenly mysteries: a faint vision of Christ's Ascension, fiery tongues representing Pentecost, and a crowned Marian figure in glory. The composition uses soft, ethereal lighting in the style of Loish or Studio Ghibli, showing the soul's posture naturally oriented and transformed by the light, with all anatomical features including hands and face clearly and correctly rendered."
