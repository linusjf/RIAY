    "image_prompt": "A deeply emotional, stylized illustration in the vein of Studio Ghibli's poignant moments, depicting a weary, sacred figure carrying a heavy wooden cross along a dusty, ancient road. The perspective is from the side, showing the immense physical strain and spiritual burden. In the foreground, a woman with a heartbroken expression, His mother, watches. A man from the crowd, Simon of Cyrene, is compelled to help shoulder the beam's weight. Another woman, Veronica, steps forward courageously through the somber crowd, holding out a simple white cloth. The scene is rendered with anatomical faithfulness in the figures, clear and distinct hands with five fingers each, and a coherent spatial arrangement that conveys the exhaustion and the path's sorrowful weight."
