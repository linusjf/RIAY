    "caption": "The sorrowful mysteries give way to glorious dawn as love conquers death.",
    "image_prompt": "A powerful triptych composition showing the transition from sorrow to glory. Left panel: a detailed depiction of the crowning with thorns, showing a figure with a sorrowful yet serene expression, the bramble crown pressing into his brow as ordinary soldiers look on. Center panel: the heavy wooden cross being carried up a narrow, rocky path under a darkened sky, the weight visibly representing universal burden. Right panel: a brilliant dawn breaking over an empty tomb, with radiant light shattering the darkness and stone rolled away, conveying the concept of death working backwards. Art style reminiscent of classical religious artwork with dramatic lighting and anatomical precision in figures."
