    "caption": "The divine journey unfolds from transcendent glory to redemptive suffering, revealing eternal mysteries.",
    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style illustration showing contrasting scenes. Left side: Christ in transfiguration glory on a mountain peak, radiant countenance shining like the sun, white garments glowing with divine light, conversing with Moses and Elijah amid luminous clouds. Right side: Christ in Gethsemane at night, kneeling in agonized prayer under ancient olive trees, sweat like drops of blood falling to the ground, with Roman soldiers approaching with torches in the distance. The composition shows the theological connection between divine glory and human suffering, rendered in the detailed, emotionally resonant style of Studio Ghibli with precise anatomy and expressive faces."
