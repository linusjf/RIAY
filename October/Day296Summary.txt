### AI-Generated Summary: On the Mountain's Height and in the Garden's Depth We Find the Mysteries

We are shown, as it were, two faces of a single coin. On one side, the shining mystery of light upon the mountain; on the other, the terrible mystery of sorrow in the garden and the judgement hall. In the first, a Man is revealed in glory so potent that His very clothes become light and the great Lawgiver and the great Prophet attend Him, while the Voice from the cloud declares what He is. This is no mere teacher, but the very Son, the Beloved. We are commanded to listen to Him.

And what does He say, this Beloved Son, when we listen? He gives us Himself. In the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the cup, He performs the ultimate magic, making common things the vehicle of His very life, His body and blood, given for the forgiveness of sins. It is the new covenant, sealed not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own.

Yet this path leads downward from the table, into the shadows of a garden. There we see the same Beloved Son, His soul sorrowful even unto death, pleading that the bitter cup might pass from Him, yet bending His human will to the Father's. So great is the struggle that His sweat falls like drops of blood, a sign of the inward battle that precedes the outward violence.

And that violence comes soon enough. The One who was clothed in light is now stripped and bound to a pillar. There He is scourged, the cruel whip, with its thongs of bone and metal, tearing at His flesh. This is the price, it seems, of the covenant; this is what it looks like when the Blood of the Son is poured out for many.
