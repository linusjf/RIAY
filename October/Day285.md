### AI-Generated Summary: On the Joyful Discovery in the Temple and Those First Glimpses of Light at the River and the Feast

We are told of that moment every parent dreads and then treasures, when the boy was lost and found again not among kin or caravan, but in His Father’s house, asking and answering questions that hinted at a deeper home. This is the fifth joyful mystery.

Then comes a new dawn, a series of luminous mysteries breaking upon the world. The first is at the river Jordan, where the sinless one is baptized, not because He had any filth to wash away, but to hallow all waters and to bow the divine head in solidarity with our plight. The second is at a wedding in Cana, where water was turned to wine; a quiet, almost secret, beginning of the new creation, where ordinary things are filled with an unlooked-for glory at His mother’s behest. The third is the proclamation itself—the call to see that the old world is dying and a Kingdom is at hand, a summons to turn from shadow and embrace the substance that has come.
