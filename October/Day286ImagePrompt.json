    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style illustration showing contrasting scenes unified by divine light. On the left, a figure radiates brilliant, ethereal light on a mountain peak, robes glowing with transcendent energy, face illuminated with otherworldly peace. On the right, the same figure kneels in a dark olive grove, head bowed under spiritual weight, with faint light emanating from within despite the surrounding shadows. Between them flows a stream of light that transforms into droplets of blood, connecting the scenes. The art style evokes the emotional depth and flowing lines of Loish's character illustrations, with anatomically correct hands and expressive faces that convey both divine glory and human suffering in perfect perspective."
