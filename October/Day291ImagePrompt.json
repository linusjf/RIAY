    "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration showing three scenes unified by a golden divine light. Left panel: The Transfiguration on a mountain peak, with a radiant figure glowing with uncreated light, three disciples shielding their eyes in awe. Central panel: The Garden of Gethsemane at night, a solitary figure in deep anguish under gnarled olive trees, with the weight of the world visibly pressing down. Right panel: The brutal Scourging, where a sacred figure endures torment while maintaining divine dignity, torn flesh contrasting with serene expression. The artwork blends Renaissance sacred art with Glen Keane's expressive character emotion and Loish's flowing lines, creating anatomically precise figures with clearly visible, well-proportioned hands and faces, all connected by a continuous stream of golden light that flows from transfiguration through suffering to redemption."
