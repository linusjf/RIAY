    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed triptych-style illustration depicting four key scenes from the joyful mysteries. Left panel: A young woman in a humble Nazareth room, bathed in celestial light as she receives divine annunciation, her expression a mix of awe and courageous acceptance. Center left: Two women embracing in a sun-drenched hill country, one visibly pregnant, with a subtle golden glow connecting them as an unborn child leaps within. Center right: A newborn king wrapped in simple cloths, resting in a stone feeding-trough in a rustic stable, surrounded by gentle animals and radiating soft light into the dark night. Right panel: An elderly man in temple garments holding an infant with reverence and peace, surrounded by the ancient architecture of Jerusalem's temple. The art style combines the lyrical linework of Loish with the emotional depth of Studio Ghibli, maintaining anatomical accuracy in all human figures with clearly visible, properly proportioned faces and hands."
