### AI-Generated Summary: On the Joyful Discovery in the Temple and the Commencement of Luminous Mysteries That Followed

My dear reader, you must picture a boy of twelve years, not lost but purposefully at work in His Father’s house, discovered there by a mother and foster-father who had sought Him with aching hearts. This, the fifth joyful mystery, reveals that even the Incarnate Word must be about His Father’s business, a truth that startles us with its divine simplicity. Then the narrative makes a curious leap, passing over the long, quiet years in Nazareth—years of humble preparation which the world is not permitted to see—to usher in a new dawn. This is the age of the luminous mysteries, where the hidden Light steps forth into the stream of common life. First, He submits to the baptism in the Jordan, hallowing the waters and receiving a voice from heaven. Next, at a wedding in Cana, He performs the first of His signs, turning water into wine at His mother’s bidding and thus gladdening the hearts of men. And then He begins His great work: the proclamation of the Kingdom and the clear, unyielding call to conversion, an invitation to turn from the shadowlands toward the splendid reality of God’s own reign.
