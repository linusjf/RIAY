  "image_prompt": "A triptych-style illustration showing three distinct scenes flowing together. On the left, a radiant figure with shining countenance and luminous robes stands on a mountain peak with two ancient prophets, beams of golden light breaking through clouds. In the center, the same figure kneels in moonlit Gethsemane, face anguished yet resolute, hands clasped in prayer as sleeping disciples rest nearby under ancient olive trees. On the right, the figure stands bound to a stone pillar, back exposed and marked, head bowed with dignity amid shadowy Roman soldiers in a torch-lit courtyard. The art style evokes sacred Renaissance frescoes with dramatic lighting and emotional intensity, maintaining anatomical accuracy in faces and hands while conveying profound spiritual narrative through composition and color transitions from gold to blue to crimson."
