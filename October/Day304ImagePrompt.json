    "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration showing five sequential scenes from the Joyful Mysteries in rich detail. Left panel: The Archangel Gabriel appearing before the Virgin Mary in a humble dwelling, divine light streaming through a window. Center panel: The Nativity scene in a rustic stable with the infant Jesus in a manger, surrounded by Mary, Joseph, and shepherds kneeling in reverence, with celestial light illuminating the humble setting. Right panel: The boy Jesus teaching in the Jerusalem temple surrounded by learned elders, with Mary and Joseph visible in the doorway. All figures display natural postures with anatomically correct hands and expressive faces, rendered in a style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli with soft colors and delicate linework, maintaining proper perspective and spatial coherence throughout the composition."
