    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration depicting four sequential vignettes of the Joyful Mysteries. First, the Annunciation shows the Archangel Gabriel with luminous wings bowing before the Virgin Mary in a simple sunlit room, her face expressing serene acceptance. Second, the Visitation portrays Mary and Elizabeth embracing warmly outside a rustic home, with a subtle golden glow connecting them as John the Baptist leaps in Elizabeth's womb. Third, the Nativity reveals the Holy Family in a humble stable, with the Christ Child radiant in a manger filled with hay, surrounded by gentle animals and starlight streaming through a crack in the roof. Fourth, the Presentation shows the elderly Simeon holding the infant Jesus with trembling reverence in the Temple courtyard, with Anna the prophetess looking on with wisdom. The composition uses flowing lines and soft watercolor-like textures inspired by illuminated manuscripts, with careful anatomical proportions in all figures and natural, expressive hand gestures throughout."
