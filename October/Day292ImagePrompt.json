    "image_prompt": "A deeply symbolic and reverent triptych-style illustration showing the transition from sorrow to glory. The left panel depicts the Crowning with Thorns in a dimly lit chamber, with Jesus wearing a purple robe and a cruel thorn circlet pressed into his brow, blood trickling down his face as soldiers mock him. The central panel shows the Carrying of the Cross - Jesus struggles under the heavy wooden cross along a dusty path to Golgotha, his face showing determination and love despite exhaustion. The right panel bursts with golden light of the Resurrection - the empty tomb with stone rolled away, radiant dawn breaking over Jerusalem, and the risen Christ in glorious light, his wounds now shining rather than bleeding. The composition flows from dark sorrow to brilliant glory, with subtle golden threads connecting human suffering to divine victory, rendered in the spiritual symbolic style of William Blake with anatomical precision in the human form and profound emotional depth."
