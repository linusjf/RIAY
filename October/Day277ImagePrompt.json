    "image_prompt": "A stylized spiritual illustration showing a symbolic path transitioning from dark, thorny shadows into radiant, glorious light. A subtle, abstract human silhouette moves along this path, with the sorrowful phase featuring crowns of thorns and heavy crosses melting into a brilliant dawn of resurrection light. The composition follows divine geometry with perfect perspective, creating a coherent visual metaphor for spiritual ascent. The art style evokes sacred illuminated manuscripts with rich colors and symbolic detail, all anatomically and spatially harmonious."
