    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style composition showing two contrasting scenes unified by the same central figure. On the left, a man radiates divine light upon a mountain peak, his garments glowing with unearthly brilliance as two ancient prophets materialize beside him in a cloud of glory. On the right, the same figure kneels in anguish in a dark olive garden, his face lifted in prayer as sweat falls like blood droplets to the ground, with Roman soldiers approaching through the shadows. The transition between scenes shows the progression from transcendent revelation to human suffering, rendered in the detailed, emotionally resonant style of Studio Ghibli with careful anatomical accuracy in hands and faces, and coherent spatial relationships throughout both environments."
