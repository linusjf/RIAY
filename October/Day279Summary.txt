### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Four Joyful Mysteries and the Curious Absence of Substantive Matter

My dear reader, one approaches these mysteries as a traveler might approach a great house, expecting to find within its rooms some furniture of the soul, some pictures upon the walls to instruct and delight. We are told of the Annunciation, where eternity broke into time through a maiden's consent; of the Visitation, where kinship and prophecy met in a hill country; of the Nativity, where the world's true King lay in a trough of hay; and of the Presentation, where an old man's arms at last held the consolation of Israel.

Yet when we enter, we find the rooms strangely bare. The prayers are repeated like familiar steps down an empty corridor, but the pictures—the artworks that might show us the angel's posture or the stable's light or the temple's ancient stones—are nowhere described. We have the names of these great events, like titles on vacant frames, but the colours and forms that make them real to our imagination have been withheld. It is as if we were given the chapter headings of a most profound story, but the pages between remain curiously, persistently blank.
