### AI-Generated Summary: On the Bitter Road of Sorrows Where the Weight of a Wooden Beam Became the Burden of the Whole World

My dear reader, let us consider the final, terrible steps of that long descent which began in a garden. First came the cruel mockery of a crown, not of gold, but of thorns. Then, weakened and sore from the scourging, He took up the heavy wooden beam and began His journey. This was the Carrying of the Cross, where upon the Via Dolorosa He bore two burdens: the physical weight of the wood and the far greater spiritual weight of the world’s sin, all amidst exhaustion and the jeers of the crowd.

In this profound sorrow, we see glimpses of our own calling. His mother watched with a pierced heart, a silent participant in the mystery of suffering. A stranger, Simon of Cyrene, was compelled to share the load, a stark reminder that we are often drafted into service for a purpose we do not yet understand. And a woman, Veronica, stepped forward with a simple, courageous act of mercy, offering a cloth to His face, which received in return a miraculous impression of His sacred countenance.

This path of sorrows culminated in the final mystery of the Crucifixion itself. Yet, the story does not end in that darkness. For the sequence then turns, as it must, to the first glorious mystery: the Resurrection. This is the triumphant rising from the dead on the third day, the shattering of sin and death’s hold, and the glorious fulfillment of the promise of life everlasting.
