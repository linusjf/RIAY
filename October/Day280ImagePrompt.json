Left panel: Jesus being baptized in the Jordan River with the Holy Spirit descending as a dove and heavenly light breaking through clouds. Center panel: The wedding at Cana showing Jesus transforming water into rich, red wine in stone jars as guests marvel. Right panel: Jesus preaching on a hillside to a diverse crowd with golden light emanating from him as he announces the Kingdom of God.
