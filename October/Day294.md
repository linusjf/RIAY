### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Four Joyful Mysteries Concerning the Angel's Message and the Lord's Humble Coming

My dear reader, let us consider together these first steps in the great story, these Joyful Mysteries which are like a door opening from eternity into time. First comes the Annunciation, where the angel, that royal messenger, does not appear to emperors in their halls but to a maiden in her quiet room, and the world’s fate hangs upon her simple, courageous fiat. Then follows the Visitation, where grace overflows from one mother to another, and the unborn prophet leaps for joy at the approach of his Lord, still hidden in His own mother’s womb—a secret recognition before either has drawn breath in the common air.

We are then brought to the Nativity itself, that stark and wondrous contradiction where the King of all worlds makes His entry not in a palace but a stable, laid in a feeding-trough for cattle, because there was no room in the inns built for men. And finally, the Presentation in the Temple, where the old law receives its author, and a just man named Simeon, who had waited his whole long life, is at last permitted to hold Salvation in his own arms and proclaim it a light for the nations. In all this we see a pattern, a divine method, where the highest things come to us by the lowest doors, and true joy is found not in splendour but in humility.
