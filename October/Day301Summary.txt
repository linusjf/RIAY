### AI-Generated Summary: On the Mountain of Light and the Depths of Sorrow Where Ancient Mysteries Were Revealed

My dear reader, let us consider together these great pillars upon which our faith is built. First, we are taken to the high mountain, where the Lord’s very countenance shone as the sun and His raiment became white as light itself. There He spoke with Moses and Elijah of the departure He was to accomplish at Jerusalem, and the Voice from the cloud declared Him the beloved Son, whom we are commanded to hear. Then, in the upper room, He gave us the most profound of gifts: taking the bread and the cup, He bestowed His very Self, His body given and His blood poured out, as the new and everlasting covenant.

From this sublime height, we are led down into the shadows of the olive press, to the garden where His soul was sorrowful unto death and where He prayed in such agony that His sweat became as great drops of blood, submitting wholly to the Father’s will. And from that garden, He was taken to the pillar, where He was bound and scourged, His flesh torn by the cruel whip, bearing that which we, by our sins, justly deserved.
