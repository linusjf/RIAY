### AI-Generated Summary: On the Mountain of Glory and in the Garden of Sorrow Where the Divine Light Was Veiled and Blood Was Poured Out

We are shown, my dear reader, a most profound pattern in the divine drama, where glory and sorrow are woven together in a tapestry beyond our full comprehension. First, we ascend the mountain to witness the Transfiguration, where the Master’s hidden glory blazes forth for a moment, a startling glimpse of the reality that clothes Him. From this peak, we are led directly to the upper room, where He performs a greater miracle still, veiling that same glory under the humble forms of bread and wine, instituting the Holy Eucharist as His perpetual presence and sacrifice.

Then, the path turns sharply downward into the shadows of the olive grove. Here, in the Agony of the Garden, the weight of the world’s sorrow presses upon Him, and He who is the source of all life confronts the terror of death. From this spiritual anguish follows the physical reality of the Scourging at the Pillar, where His sacred flesh is torn and His blood is poured out in a dreadful prelude to the final sacrifice.

See how the mysteries speak to one another. The glory on the mountain finds its strange and terrible fulfillment in the suffering of the garden and the pillar. And the blood He first offered in the mystery of the cup in the upper room is, before the night is out, shed physically from His wounded frame. It is a single, seamless act of giving, from the heights of Tabor to the depths of Gethsemane, all for love of us.
