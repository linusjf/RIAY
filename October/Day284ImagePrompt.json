  "image_prompt": "A stylized triptych illustration showing five sequential scenes in warm, luminous colors. First, a young woman in simple robes receives celestial light in a humble room. Second, two women embrace on a sun-drenched hillside with one visibly pregnant. Third, a newborn rests in hay within a rustic stable surrounded by gentle farm animals. Fourth, an elderly priest holds an infant before temple altars as a mother watches with solemn expression. Fifth, a young boy engages in animated discussion with bearded scholars in a sunlit courtyard. All figures have clearly visible, anatomically correct faces and hands with distinct fingers, rendered in a style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli with soft lines and ethereal lighting that connects the scenes as a continuous narrative of divine humility entering ordinary human spaces."
