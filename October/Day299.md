### AI-Generated Summary: On the First Glad Tidings Which Came to a Waiting World

My dear reader, let us consider together these first glad tidings, these joyful mysteries which are not so much puzzles to be solved as windows into a deeper country. The first was the Annunciation, where the great shout from the silence came to a maiden in Nazareth, and the eternal entered time through a young woman’s humble and courageous “let it be.” This was followed by the Visitation, a journey of charity where one mother’s greeting became a sacrament to another, and the unborn prophet leaped for joy in the presence of his hidden Lord, while the mother of all living sang her Magnificat to the hills.

Then came the Nativity, the central event around which all history turns, where the King of the Universe was laid in a feeding-trough because the world He made had no room for Him. And finally, the Presentation, where the old law and the new hope met in the temple, and an old man, his long watch ended, held the Consolation of Israel in his arms and knew at last that he was free to depart in peace. In these simple, homely things we find the very hinges upon which our world turns.
