  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Renaissance-style painting depicting the moment of Pentecost. Ordinary men, flawed and fearful, stand in a dimly lit room, their faces suddenly illuminated by tongues of uncreated fire descending from above. At the center, a rugged fisherman—Simon Peter—transformed, his weathered face alight with divine radiance, his mouth open as if speaking with supernatural authority. The atmosphere is charged with mystery and awe, golden flames flickering without consuming, casting deep shadows and ethereal highlights. The composition suggests both human frailty and divine power, with loose brushstrokes evoking movement and energy, as if the scene is alive with the Spirit's presence."
