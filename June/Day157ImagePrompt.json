  "image_prompt": "A grand Renaissance painting depicting two contrasting scenes. Above, Christ stands in luminous glory on a mountaintop, His robes glowing with divine light, flanked by the solemn figures of Moses and Elijah, their faces reverent. A golden haze envelops them, suggesting transcendence. Below, in shadowed chaos, a group of disciples recoil in awe and confusion, their expressions ranging from fear to wonder. A tormented boy writhes on the ground, his body contorted, while a desperate father pleads for help. The composition masterfully balances the ethereal serenity of the divine with the raw human struggle, connected by the unseen presence of faith."
