### AI-Generated Summary: The Meekness of the Boy Christ and the Courage of Knowing  

Consider, dear reader, the painting by William Holman Hunt, *The Finding of the Savior in the Temple*. Here, the young Jesus stands serene amidst the learned men of Jerusalem, His bare feet upon the temple’s patterned stones, His mother whispering near. The Pharisees, clad in embroidered robes, debate with furrowed brows, yet the Child speaks with a quiet authority that needs no raised voice.  

How unlike our own trembling hearts! At twelve, many of us quake at the mere thought of standing before others—recalling, perhaps, some schoolroom recitation where our knees shook like reeds in the wind. But the Boy Christ, though meek, was never timid. His confidence flowed not from arrogance, but from the sure knowledge of who He was: the beloved Son, sent to do the Father’s will.  

Here lies the secret of true meekness—not weakness, but strength held gently. It is the freedom of a child who, trusting his father’s word, declines the forbidden film without fuss, and finds his friends follow willingly. It is the quiet voice that refuses gossip in the workplace, not from fear of man, but from love of truth.  

Let us then ask for grace to walk as He walked: unshaken by scorn, unswayed by praise, rooted in the love that casts out fear. For only when we know whose we are can we stand, like the Boy in the temple, both humble and bold.
