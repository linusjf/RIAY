  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, luminous depiction of Jan van Eyck’s *The Annunciation*, showcasing the intricate transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. The scene is bathed in soft, ethereal light, with Mary standing humbly before the angel, her hands raised in acceptance. The tiled floor beneath them is adorned with symbolic motifs of David and Samson, hinting at ancient victories. The composition is rich with symbolism—divine light streaming through stained glass, inverted Latin script floating upward, and a sense of quiet reverence permeating the space. The colors are deep yet radiant, with gold accents highlighting sacred elements, creating a visual dialogue between the earthly and the divine."
