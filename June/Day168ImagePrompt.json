  "image_prompt": "A grand fresco depicting the coronation of Mary by the Trinity, bathed in celestial light. Mary, serene yet bearing the marks of earthly sorrow, kneels as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit place a radiant crown upon her head. Surrounding her are saints, including Joseph with a quiet, reverent expression and John the Baptist holding a lamb. The scene is rich with golden hues, intricate drapery, and a sense of divine order, blending earthly humility with heavenly triumph. The background features soft clouds and faint glimpses of angelic choirs, symbolizing the intersection of suffering and eternal joy."
