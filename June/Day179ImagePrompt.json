  "caption": "A moment of intimate betrayal under a stormy sky, where sorrow and violence collide in the flicker of torchlight.",
  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Renaissance-style painting depicting the arrest of Christ, with Judas in a vivid yellow cloak leaning in for the fatal kiss. Christ stands serene yet sorrowful, his gaze meeting Judasâ€™s. Around them, a chaotic crowd brandishes torches and weapons, their faces twisted in anger or shock. Peter, wild-eyed, draws a knife in the background. The scene is set at midnight, the sky heavy with foreboding clouds, the flickering torchlight casting deep shadows on the figures. The composition emphasizes the tension between intimacy and violence, with rich textures in the fabrics and expressive, emotive faces."
