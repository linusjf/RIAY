### AI-Generated Summary: The Light and the Song  

Behold *Simeon’s Song of Praise* by Arent de Gelder, a pupil of Rembrandt, where light and shadow dance as if heaven itself leaned near. The old priest Simeon, robed in solemn vestments, lifts the Child—not merely an infant, but the Light of the World—whose radiance spills upon his weathered face. Mary stands by, her hands folded, her gaze inward, as one who treasures mysteries in her heart. The darkness around them is not empty; it is a canvas for revelation.  

Here is the paradox of joy and sorrow: Simeon sings while foreseeing the sword that will pierce Mary’s soul. Yet neither turns away. Mary’s prayer is no mere recitation; it is the quiet, ceaseless turning of a soul toward its Maker. The painting whispers that to hold the divine is to be both illuminated and undone.  

And what of us? We are called to walk as Mary did—not in strength of our own, but in the steady light of Him who first kindled it. To rejoice, to ponder, to suffer, yet always to cling. For in that clinging, even shadows become holy.
