  "image_prompt": "A dramatic scene in an ancient setting: a woman, her face etched with fear and shame, stands at the center of a semi-circle of angry men, each gripping a stone, their expressions twisted with judgment. In the foreground, a serene figure kneels, writing in the dust with a finger, His presence radiating calm authority. The tension is palpable—some stones have already fallen to the ground, while others hesitate in clenched fists. The light filters softly, highlighting the contrast between wrath and mercy, condemnation and grace. The background features weathered stone walls and dusty ground, evoking the weight of the moment."
