The disciples, dressed in ancient robes, are shown in various states of panicâ€”some rowing desperately, others clinging to the sides, their faces etched with fear. In the stern, Jesus lies asleep, serene and untouched by the chaos, illuminated by a faint divine light. The waves crash violently around them, yet His presence suggests an impending calm. The contrast between the storm's fury and His stillness creates a powerful tension."
