  "caption": "The paradox of the cross—weight and lightness, agony and peace—captured in a moment of divine resolve.",
  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-inspired scene of Christ carrying the cross, His face illuminated with quiet determination amidst the shadows. The heavy wooden cross presses into His shoulder, splinters catching the light, while two women stand nearby—one radiant with devotion, her hands clasped in prayer, the other veiled in grief, her face half-hidden. Simon of Cyrene strains beside Christ, his muscles taut under the shared burden. The background is a dramatic interplay of chiaroscuro, with a faint golden glow hinting at resurrection beyond the suffering. The composition evokes both the physical weight of the cross and the spiritual lightness of surrender."
