  "image_prompt": "A grand fresco depicting the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, robed in vibrant red and blue, being lifted by a host of radiant angels against a golden sky. Below, a diverse crowd of kings, popes, knights, and maidens stand in reverence, some with hands clasped in prayer, others reaching toward her in devotion. The scene is bathed in celestial light, evoking a sense of divine triumph and eternal promise. The composition blends Renaissance grandeur with a hint of 19th-century romanticism, emphasizing rich colors, flowing drapery, and ethereal details."
