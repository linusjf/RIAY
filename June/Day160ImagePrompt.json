  "caption": "A divine struggle of light and shadow in Caravaggio's masterpiece, where Christ's silent suffering meets the torment of human cruelty.",
  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque painting in the style of Caravaggio, depicting Christ bound to a column, illuminated by a stark, divine light against a dark background. Three tormentors encircle Himâ€”one striking with visible hatred, another half-turned in cowardice, and a third calculating with cold intent. The chiaroscuro technique heightens the contrast between suffering and sin, with Christ's serene yet pained expression as the focal point. The scene is rich in texture, from the rough wood of the column to the folds of the figures' robes, evoking a visceral sense of tension and spiritual conflict."
