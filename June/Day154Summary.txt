### AI-Generated Summary: The Humble Majesty of Divine Obedience  

Here we behold a scene both tender and mighty: the Son of God, sinless yet submitting to the waters, and His herald John, trembling at the weight of his task. In this sacred moment, as in the Annunciation, humility is the threshold of glory. The dove descends not upon the proud, but upon the obedient—those who, like Mary, whisper *fiat*, or like John, yield despite their unworthiness.  

Christ’s baptism reveals a paradox: the Almighty kneels, the Sinless One is washed, and in this act, righteousness is fulfilled. The Spirit descends where hearts are lowly, not where crowns are grasped. So too must we learn that true confidence springs not from self-assertion, but from surrender. To obey is not to cower; it is to stand firm in the current of God’s will, knowing that the humble hand receiving the dove is mightier than the clenched fist of kings.  

Let us then pray—not as those bargaining with heaven, but as children trusting a Father. For the same Spirit that hovered over Jordan waits to hallow the willing heart. *Our Father... Hail Mary...* Thus ends our meditation, but not our calling.
