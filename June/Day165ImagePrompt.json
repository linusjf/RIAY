  "image_prompt": "A luminous depiction of Christ ascending into heaven, His figure radiant with divine light, surrounded by swirling clouds and golden rays. Below, the Virgin Mary and the apostles stand on a rocky outcrop, their faces a mix of sorrow and wonder, hands raised or clasped in prayer. At the center of the scene, two faint but distinct footprints are etched into the stone, glowing softly as if imbued with sacred presence. The landscape is serene, with hints of dawn breaking over distant hills, symbolizing both departure and eternal promise. The composition balances grandeur and intimacy, with flowing robes, detailed expressions, and a celestial atmosphere that draws the viewer upward."
