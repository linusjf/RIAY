  "image_prompt": "A grand banquet hall inspired by Veronese's *The Wedding at Cana*, filled with opulent detailsâ€”rich fabrics, golden goblets, and a hundred guests in vibrant attire. The bride, adorned in an intricate gown, and Christ, serene and luminous, lock eyes across the table, their expressions transcending the revelry. In the lower corner, servants pour water into stone jars, the liquid shimmering as it transforms into wine. The background subtly mirrors *The Mona Lisa* on a distant wall, drawing their gaze. The scene balances grandeur with quiet divinity, light cascading to emphasize the unnoticed miracle."
