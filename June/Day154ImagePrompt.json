The sinless Son of God kneels in the water, His face serene yet resolute, as John the Baptist, awestruck and humbled, pours water over Him. Above them, a radiant dove descends from a golden-lit sky, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The river glows with divine light, and the surrounding landscape is peaceful yet charged with spiritual significance. The atmosphere is one of profound humility and divine fulfillment, capturing the paradox of the Almighty submitting to human ritual."
