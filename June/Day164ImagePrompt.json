  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque-style scene inspired by Caravaggio, with intense chiaroscuro lighting. The resurrected Christ, bathed in a soft golden glow, stands with an expression of gentle compassion. He holds the wrist of St. Thomas, whose face is a mix of awe and trepidation, as the disciple's finger hovers near the wound in Christ's side. The other apostles watch in hushed reverence, their faces partially shadowed. The atmosphere is solemn yet charged with sacred intimacy, emphasizing the moment where doubt meets divine revelation. The background is dark, focusing all attention on the illuminated interaction between Christ and Thomas."
