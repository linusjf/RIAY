Angels walk beside her, some with hands raised in blessing, others hovering above as luminous guardians. In the distance, Elizabeth stands at the entrance of a sunlit village, her arms outstretched in joyful anticipation. The landscape is rugged but bathed in golden light, symbolizing both the difficulty and the sacred purpose of the journey. Mary's expression reflects quiet strength, her posture resolute, embodying unwavering faith and love."
