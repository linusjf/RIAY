  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Mannerist-style scene in a moonlit garden: the Son of Man, robed in deep blue and crimson, kneels in prayer, His face anguished yet resolute, hands clasped in surrender. Above Him, a radiant angel descends from a shaft of golden light, bearing a glowing chalice wreathed in ethereal flames. Around them, disciples lie asleep in tangled posturesâ€”Peter with his sword half-drawn, John curled like a child, their robes pooling in shadow. The background swirls with twisted olive trees, their branches clawing at a stormy sky, while distant torchlights hint at approaching soldiers. The composition bends perspective to draw all lines toward the central figure, where divine light meets human shadow, and every fold of fabric, blade of grass, and play of chiaroscuro heightens the tension between agony and transcendence."
