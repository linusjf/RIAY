  "image_prompt": "A dimly lit barn interior, heavy with shadows yet pierced by a single shaft of celestial light illuminating a newborn child swaddled in rough cloth. The Virgin Mary, her face a mix of exhaustion and awe, cradles the infant while St. Francis and St. Lawrence kneel on the packed earth, their weathered hands clasped in prayer. A hovering angel, barely more than a suggestion of wings and radiance, points toward the child with reverence. Straw scatters across cracked wooden beams, and the air hums with silent reverence—divinity clothed in fragility, eternity resting in a feed trough."
