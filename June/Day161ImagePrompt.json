  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque-style painting in the manner of Caravaggio, depicting Christ in the 'Ecce Homo' scene. He stands bound, wearing a crown of thorns, His face serene yet marked with suffering. Blood trickles from His wounds, illuminated by a stark chiaroscuro light that casts deep shadows. Pontius Pilate gestures toward Him with a conflicted expression, while bystanders—some mocking, some hesitant—fill the background. The composition is intense, with rich textures in the fabrics and raw emotion in the figures, evoking both cruelty and redemption."
