  "caption": "A divine figure bound in luminous sorrow, surrounded by indifference and cruelty, while an innocent child looks on—unseen love in the midst of suffering.",
  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, Baroque-style painting depicting the flagellation of a radiant, wounded figure with a heavenly gaze, bound to a column. The surrounding crowd is a mix of indifferent onlookers and aggressive tormentors, their faces etched with varying degrees of malice. A small child, lifted high above the scene, gazes down with innocent confusion, bathed in soft light that contrasts the harsh shadows of violence. The composition is masterfully lit, with dramatic chiaroscuro emphasizing the divine figure's luminous wounds and the raw emotion of the moment. The textures—rough ropes, gleaming blood, flowing robes—are rendered with hyper-realistic precision, evoking both awe and sorrow."
