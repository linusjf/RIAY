  "caption": "The wounded gaze of Christ upon a world of mockery, indifference, and tender love at the foot of the cross.",
  "image_prompt": "A dramatic close-up perspective from the viewpoint of Christ on the cross, looking down upon the crowd at Calvary. The scene is filled with contrasting expressions: faces contorted in mockery, others blank with apathy, and a small group—including the Virgin Mary, John the beloved disciple, and Mary Magdalene—weeping with devotion. The lighting is stark, with shafts of light breaking through stormy skies to illuminate the tear-streaked faces of the faithful, while shadows deepen the harsh lines of the scoffers. The foreground subtly hints at the wounded hands of Jesus, nails visible, with blood trickling down the rough wood of the cross. The composition evokes both the brutality of the moment and the profound tenderness in Christ's gaze as it lingers on those who love Him."
