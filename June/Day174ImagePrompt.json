  "image_prompt": "A dramatic biblical scene inspired by Ivanov's *The Appearance of Christ Before the People*. John the Baptist, wearing rough camel's hair, stands with his arm outstretched toward Christ, who appears in the distance wearing a blue cloak and red tunic, emanating quiet divinity. Around them, a crowd of disciples, seekers, and historical figures like the artist Ivanov and Gogol react with expressions of wonder, skepticism, and hope. The Jordan River winds through the rocky landscape, its waters disturbed by those stepping forward for baptism. The lighting is soft yet radiant, casting a golden glow over the scene, emphasizing the spiritual significance of the moment. The composition balances classical precision with emotional depth, capturing both the humility of John and the quiet majesty of Christ's arrival."
