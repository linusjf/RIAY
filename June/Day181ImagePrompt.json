  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque-style painting of Christ being crowned with thorns, His face serene yet marked by suffering, surrounded by soldiers with expressions of mockery and indifference. The composition is dynamic, with strong diagonal lines emphasizing movement—light cascades from above, illuminating Christ’s figure while shadows deepen the brutality of the scene. A dog barks in the foreground, oblivious to the sacred moment, while distant onlookers, including a figure in red robes (possibly Pilate), observe with mixed expressions of guilt and detachment. The crown of thorns is pressed down by a soldier’s rough hands, blood trickling onto Christ’s brow. The background hints at a stone cell, with a barred window casting fractured light. The atmosphere is charged with tension, contrasting earthly cruelty with divine resignation, evoking the theological paradox of weakness as true power."
