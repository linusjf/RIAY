  "image_prompt": "A dimly lit street at dusk, the air heavy with quiet solemnity. At the center stands Christ, draped in flowing white robes, holding a wooden staff, His face illuminated with gentle resolve. Before Him, two disciples—one with hands clasped in pleading, the other with bowed head in patient waiting. Shadowed figures linger near a weathered wooden door, their faces half-hidden in the fading light. The scene is painted in Tanner’s signature style, with deep contrasts of light and shadow, evoking a sense of sacred anticipation. The atmosphere is thick with unspoken sorrow and divine love, capturing the quiet before the ultimate sacrifice."
