  "image_prompt": "A Byzantine-style icon depicting the Transfiguration of Christ, bathed in celestial golden light, His garments glowing white as snow. Moses and Elijah stand beside Him, their faces serene and luminous, framed by a mandorla of divine radiance. Below, three disciples react in aweâ€”one shielding his eyes, another fallen to his knees, and a third daring to gaze upward, his dark robes contrasting with the heavenly brilliance. The background is a deep azure, with stylized mountain peaks and golden halos emphasizing the sacred moment. The composition draws the eye toward Christ, the focal point of transcendent glory, while intricate details in the figures' expressions and garments convey both divine majesty and human wonder."
