### AI-Generated Summary: The Humble Majesty of Caravaggio’s Lost Nativity

Consider, if you will, a painting—now vanished, stolen from the world’s sight—where light and shadow conspire to reveal a truth too often forgotten. Caravaggio, that master of stark realism, once depicted the birth of our Lord not in regal splendor, but in a barn’s quiet obscurity. The Virgin gazes upon her child; St. Francis and St. Lawrence kneel in awe, their lives of poverty and service now bending toward the poverty of God Himself. An angel descends, not with fanfare, but as a whisper, pointing to the infant who is both Maker and made.

Here lies the divine paradox: the One who is Beauty, Strength, and Eternal Life lies swaddled in straw. St. Francis knew this well—his _Praises of God_ exalts the Almighty’s majesty, yet it is that very majesty which makes the manger so staggering. For how could He who is Sufficiency become needful? How could the Refuge of all souls have no roof but a stable’s beams? The prayer of the saints, like Caravaggio’s brush, directs us not to marvels afar, but to the near, the lowly, the human face of Love.

And so we are left with this: to see in Mary’s child the fullness of God’s humility, and in His humility, the fullness of His power. Let us pray for grace to kneel with Francis and Lawrence, to adore not merely the idea of Incarnation, but the dusty, radiant fact of it. For in that stable, eternity entered time, and the shadows of a fallen world were pierced by uncreated Light.
