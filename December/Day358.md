### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Glorious Mysteries and a Painting of the Coronation Involving the Trinity - Day 358

Now, consider the five Glorious Mysteries. The first is the Resurrection, which is connected to baptism and a newness of life. The second is the Ascension, where we are told Jesus is seated at the right hand of the Father and is attentively present to individuals. The third is the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, which calls to mind a verse from Ezekiel concerning a new heart and a new spirit. The fourth is the Assumption of Mary, who is in glory as a perfect disciple. The fifth is the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth.

A painting by Diego Velasquez is mentioned, which depicts this coronation as involving all three persons of the Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The text describes Mary's relationship to each person.
