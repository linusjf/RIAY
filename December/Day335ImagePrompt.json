  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent concept art illustration depicting a unified visual journey through the Five Glorious Mysteries. The composition is divided into five distinct yet connected vignettes in a heavenly, gold-accented space. From left to right: 1) A serene, triumphant figure stands upon a stone tomb at dawn, holding a banner, with armored guards asleep below. 2) A figure radiant with light ascends into a shell of golden clouds, while figures below gaze upward in awe. 3) A divine tempest with a central radiant dove sends tongues of flame onto the bowed heads of a gathered group, including a central female figure. 4) A graceful female figure is borne upward on a soft cloud by cherubs, lifted effortlessly toward a heavenly light. 5) In a court of gold leaf, a crowned son places a queenly crown upon a mother's brow, surrounded by a harmonious circle of saints and angels in adoration. The style blends the detailed iconography of Renaissance frescoes with the flowing, expressive linework and luminous color palette of artists like Loish and Studio Ghibli, ensuring anatomical correctness and clear, expressive faces and hands throughout."
