  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, reverent triptych-style illustration blending the artistic styles of the Renaissance masters mentioned. The central panel depicts the Resurrection: Christ stands calmly upon an open, geometric sarcophagus in a dawn-lit garden, with Roman guards asleep in foreshortened poses. The left panel shows the Ascension: Christ is received into a radiant mandorla of golden light, His disciples below gazing up with awe in a softly shadowed landscape. The right panel portrays Pentecost: The Virgin Mary and Apostles are gathered in a dynamic composition, tongues of ethereal fire descending upon them, their elongated forms illuminated by a supernatural, warm light. The overall scene is unified by a celestial gold background, with subtle geometric patterns and divine light beams connecting the mysteries, rendered in a style that combines Piero della Francesca's serene geometry, El Greco's expressive energy, and Fra Angelico's luminous clarity."
