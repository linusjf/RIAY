  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscripts and Studio Ghibli's delicate artistry, depicting five small, sequential vignettes for the Joyful Mysteries. From left to right: 1) The Annunciation shows the Archangel Gabriel with detailed wings before a humble Mary in a sunlit room, a dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit overhead. 2) The Visitation portrays Mary and Elizabeth embracing warmly in a lush garden, their faces showing joyful recognition. 3) The Nativity centers on Mary, with anatomically correct hands, gently swaddling the infant Jesus in a manger under starlight, with Joseph nearby. 4) The Presentation shows the elderly, devout Simeon holding the child Jesus with awe in the temple, Mary and Joseph observing. 5) The Finding in the Temple depicts a young Jesus teaching among scholars, his posture confident, with Mary and Joseph searching in the background. The composition is unified by a flowing, decorative botanical border, with soft lighting and a cohesive, peaceful color palette of blues, golds, and earth tones."
