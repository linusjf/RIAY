### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Sorrowful Mysteries, the Garden, the Scourging, the Crown, the Procession, and the Cross - Day 350

Now, consider these five sorrowful mysteries. The first finds Him in the garden, taking upon Himself the weight of sin, a thing prefigured by the old scapegoat and the very Lamb of God. The second is the scourging at the pillar, where His blood is poured out. The third brings the crowning with thorns, a crown not of honour but of indignity. In the fourth, He carries the cross; and here we are told of a painting by Peter Bruegel, *The Procession to Calvary*, which shows Roman soldiers with varied reactions, and among them, a soldier’s act of faith. The fifth and final mystery is the crucifixion itself, where His mother stands at the foot of the cross.
