  "image_prompt": "A deeply symbolic triptych-style illustration in the manner of sacred fresco art, blending the styles of Vicente Masip and Petro Gagliardi. The left panel shows Jesus in agony in Gethsemane at night, an angel offering strength, with Judas approaching in the distance, his halo half-gold and half-black. The central panel merges the scourging at the pillar, the crowning with thorns by mocking soldiers, and the carrying of the cross with Simon of Cyrene, all under a sorrowful, stormy sky. The right panel depicts the crucifixion on Golgotha, with a brilliant, hopeful rainbow arching over the scene, symbolizing the new covenant. The composition is unified, with anatomically faithful figures expressing profound emotion, detailed textures of stone, wood, and fabric, and a coherent, dramatic lighting that guides the viewer through the narrative from darkness to promised light."
