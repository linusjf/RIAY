### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Luminous Mysteries Concerning the Baptism at Jordan, the Wedding at Cana, the Proclamation, the Transfiguration, and the Eucharist - Day 359

We are told of the First Luminous Mystery, which is the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, and a reading from St. Ambrose concerning the Father's voice from heaven. Then comes the second, the wedding feast at Cana, accompanied by a writing from Saint Alphonsus Liguori regarding the intercessory power of Mary. The third Mystery is the proclamation of the kingdom and the call to conversion; here is referenced James Tissot's painting *Healing of the Lepers at Capernaum*, and it is said that one leper is shown kneeling in gratitude. The fourth is the Transfiguration, which describes the experience of Peter, James, and John upon the mountain. The fifth and final Mystery is the institution of the Eucharist, which the text links, by the words of Jesus Himself, to the washing of the feet.
