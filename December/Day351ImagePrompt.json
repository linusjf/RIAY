    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych illustration depicting the five Glorious Mysteries as interconnected spiritual scenes. Left panel: A luminous, private moment of resurrection in a garden at dawn, light emanating from a figure. Center-left: A figure ascending into a radiant, cloud-filled sky, with figures below gazing upward with longing. Center: A dramatic descent of the Holy Spirit as tongues of fire upon gathered figures, with a transformed Peter holding keys prominently in the foreground. Center-right: The Assumption of a serene female figure, borne upwards by angels into a heavenly glow. Right panel: A coronation in heaven, where a humble female figure is crowned queen not by force but by divine grace, surrounded by celestial light and adoration. The style is cohesive, with flowing lines, warm ethereal lighting, and influences from sacred Renaissance art and modern devotional illustration, ensuring anatomical correctness and clear, expressive faces and hands."
