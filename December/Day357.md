### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Sorrowful Mysteries and the View from the Cross as Depicted in a Particular Work of Art - Day 357

Now, consider the five Sorrowful Mysteries. The first is the agony in the garden, where He takes upon Himself all evil, sin, and suffering. The second is the scourging at the pillar, which fixes our attention upon His shed blood. The third is the crowning with thorns, where He is mocked. The fourth is the carrying of the cross, where He fully embraces it. And the fifth is the crucifixion. Here we are told of a piece of sacred art entitled _What Our Lord Saw from the Cross_ by James Tisseau, a work painted from the perspective of Jesus looking out. We are encouraged, in light of this, to imagine looking from the cross at Mary. The matter concludes with prayers.
