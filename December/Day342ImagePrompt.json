  "image_prompt": "A sequence of five stylized, luminous illustrations in the manner of sacred iconography and Studio Ghibli's delicate artistry. 1: The Annunciation: A young woman in a simple room, her face serene and humble, looks upon a towering, gentle column of golden light that represents the angel Gabriel. 2: The Visitation: Two women embrace in a sun-drenched courtyard, one with hands placed on the other's womb, where a soft, divine light glows from within. 3: The Nativity: In a rustic, peaceful stable, a new mother gently places a warmly swaddled infant in a hay-filled manger, soft starlight illuminating the scene as Joseph watches protectively. 4: The Presentation: An elderly man in temple robes cradles the child with awe and joy before an altar, while a prophetess looks on with knowing gratitude. 5: The Finding in the Temple: A boy of twelve sits earnestly among learned teachers in a grand, sunbeam-filled temple hall, his parents framed in the doorway with expressions of relief and wonder. Each panel is cohesive, with anatomically correct figures, clear perspective, and a unifying palette of gold, blue, and warm earth tones."
