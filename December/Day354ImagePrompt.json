  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscript art combined with the soft, contemplative light of a Rembrandt painting. The scene shows an open, aged prayer book on a wooden surface. From its pages, five distinct, glowing vignettes emerge like jewels in a spiral rosary pattern: the Annunciation with a dove, the Visitation of two embracing figures in a pool of light, a Nativity scene with a radiant infant, the Presentation at a temple altar with an elderly prophetess, and the Finding in the Temple with a young Jesus teaching before astonished listeners. The overall composition is geometrically balanced and spatially coherent, with warm shadows and precise, detailed linework. The hands of the figures are clearly visible and anatomically correct."
