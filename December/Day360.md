### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Sorrowful Mysteries and the Prayer of Submission, the Scourging, the Mockery, the Burden Shared, and the Final Rent Veil - Day 360

Now, consider the first of these sorrows: the agony in the garden. There, we are told, a prayer was uttered—"My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." Here is the perfect model of submission, a turning of the human will upon the very hinge of the universe.

The second mystery brings the scourging at the pillar. And here lies a bitter irony, for the crowd chose Barabbas—whose name, we are reminded, means "son of the father"—in preference to the true Son.

Then comes the crowning with thorns, a brutal mockery where a crown of that sharp plant was placed upon his head in jest, a dreadful parody of kingship.

The fourth sorrow is the carrying of the cross. We read that a man, Simon of Cyrene, was compelled to bear it, a picture of how burdens are sometimes laid upon us from without.

Finally, the crucifixion itself, where the great veil of the temple was torn, a rent from top to bottom. And so the mysteries conclude, followed by a prayer.
