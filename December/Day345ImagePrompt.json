  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych-style illustration depicting five distinct scenes in a cohesive, flowing composition. From left to right: 1) Christ standing in the Jordan River, a luminous dove descending as light breaks through clouds. 2) The wedding at Cana, with Christ gesturing towards stone jars as water transforms into deep red wine. 3) Christ preaching on a hillside to a diverse crowd, with subtle auras of healing light around individuals. 4) The Transfiguration on a mountain peak, Christ radiant with light, flanked by Moses and Elijah, with three awestruck disciples below. 5) The Last Supper, Christ breaking bread, light emanating from the loaf and chalice. The art style is influenced by the luminous, emotive quality of sacred iconography and the fluid, expressive linework of artists like Loish, with warm, rich colors and a sense of divine light unifying all five moments."
