  "image_prompt": "A detailed, somber painting in the style of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depicting *The Procession to Calvary*. The scene is a vast, crowded landscape under a heavy sky. Roman soldiers on horseback, with varied expressions of duty, boredom, and indifference, lead the procession. In the foreground, one soldier, distinct in his solemnity, looks upon the condemned figure of Christ carrying the cross with an expression of dawning faith and pity. The composition masterfully balances the epic scale of the event with intimate human detail, capturing the weight of the sorrowful mystery within a historically rich Flemish setting."
