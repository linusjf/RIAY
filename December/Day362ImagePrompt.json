  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscript art blended with serene digital painting. The scene is divided into five vertical panels like a stained-glass window. From top to bottom: 1) A radiant, empty tomb at dawn with a figure turning away in awe. 2) Christ ascending into a swirl of clouds, viewed from below by gazing apostles with expressions of great joy. 3) A diverse group of people indoors, each crowned with a stylized flame, their faces upturned in awe as golden light streams down. 4) The Assumption of Mary, depicted as a woman in flowing robes being gently lifted by beams of light into a starry sky. 5) Mary crowned as Queen, seated in a celestial realm with sun and moon beneath her feet, gesturing with grace and intercession. The overall composition is cohesive, with a flowing, decorative border of vines and stars connecting the panels. The lighting is soft and ethereal, with a focus on clear, expressive faces and hands."
