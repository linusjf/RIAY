    "image_prompt": "A detailed, stylized illustration in the manner of Sienese Gothic tempera painting, inspired by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. The scene depicts the Presentation in the Temple. The elderly Simeon, dressed in richly patterned robes, gently receives the Christ Child from the Virgin Mary, who is draped in a deep blue mantle. Joseph stands nearby, holding two white doves. The figures are arranged with elegant, flowing lines and solemn expressions, creating a reverent atmosphere. The background features architectural elements of a temple with intricate patterning and a golden, textured halo of light. The overall style is formal and detailed, with a balanced composition and a palette of deep blues, golds, and earthy tones."
