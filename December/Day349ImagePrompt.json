  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscripts and frescoes by artists like Fra Angelico. The scene is a cohesive triptych or polyptych showing five distinct vignettes representing the Joyful Mysteries: 1) The Annunciation with Archangel Gabriel bowing before a reverent Virgin Mary. 2) The Visitation showing Mary and Elizabeth embracing. 3) The Nativity with the Christ child veiled in human form, radiating a soft, divine light. 4) The Presentation in the Temple, where Mary's serene, focused gaze on Jesus contrasts with the commotion of the crowd. 5) The Finding in the Temple, depicting Mary and Joseph's moment of discovery, with Jesus teaching. The composition is unified by a golden, intricate border, with figures rendered with anatomical faithfulness, expressive hands, and peaceful, detailed faces. The overall lighting is soft and celestial, suggesting a state of prayerful contemplation."
