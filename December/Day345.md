### AI-Generated Summary: A Consideration of the Five Luminous Mysteries and Their Meditations for the Rosary - Day 345

Now, it is a curious and wholesome thing to fix one’s mind not on vague spiritualities, but on certain solid pictures—mysteries, as they are called. The first is of a man, sinless, standing in a river to be baptised. As He emerges, the heavens are torn open, a dove descends, and a Voice speaks of a beloved and well-pleasing Son. Here we are shown the very nature of things, and the water itself is made holy.

The second picture takes us to a wedding, where the wine has failed. His mother, with a love that sees the end from the beginning, tells the servants to do whatever He says. And He, at her word, changes water into wine, not merely any wine, but the finest. Thus His glory is first shown, and a road is opened that leads, as she knew it must, to a hill and a cross.

The third is a picture of proclamation. A voice cries that the Kingdom is at hand, and with it comes a call to turn, to change one’s very heart. This is accompanied by acts of authority—healings and exorcisms—as signs that the call is urgent and the time is now. It demands a yes.

In the fourth, we are taken up a high mountain with three disciples. There, the Man’s face shines like the sun and His clothes become white as light. Two old friends, Moses and Elijah, speak with Him of an exodus He must accomplish. A bright cloud covers them, and the same Voice from the river speaks again, commanding all to listen to this beloved Son. It is a glimpse of a glory that is always there, but seen only when one steps away from the artificial lamps of our own making.

The fifth and final picture is of a supper. He takes bread, gives thanks, breaks it, and calls it His body, given. He takes a cup and calls it the new covenant in His blood. Here, the sacrificial lamb offers Himself, and institutes a perpetual feast born of a most earnest desire: the desire to share that very meal with us.

The matter concludes with certain prayers, asking that the life shown in these pictures might be imitated and their promises obtained.
