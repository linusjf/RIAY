  "image_prompt": "A somber, reverent triptych-style illustration in the manner of sacred iconography and stained glass art. The central panel depicts the Crucifixion on Golgotha under a darkened sky, with Christ on the cross, His mother Mary and John the disciple standing below. The two side panels are divided into four smaller scenes, each rendered with deep emotion and symbolic detail: 1) The Agony in the Garden, with Christ kneeling in prayer, an angel hovering, and sleeping disciples in the foreground. 2) The Scourging at the Pillar, showing Christ bound, His back lacerated, viewed from the perspective of a sorrowful Mary in the shadows. 3) The Crowning with Thorns, with soldiers mockingly kneeling before a seated Christ wearing a purple robe and a brutal crown. 4) The Carrying of the Cross, depicting Christ stumbling under its weight, aided by Simon of Cyrene, with Veronica holding her veil bearing His image. The overall composition is unified by a palette of deep crimsons, purples, and gold, with a sense of solemn, prayerful contemplation. The figures are anatomically correct and express profound humanity and suffering."
