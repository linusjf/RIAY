  "image_prompt": "A stylized, solemn illustration depicting five symbolic vignettes in a cohesive, vertical composition, inspired by the gravitas of sacred art. At the top, a figure kneels in a dark garden under a gnarled olive tree, face upturned in anguished prayer. Below, a figure is bound to a pillar, back turned, with the ethereal, ghostly forms of scourges in motion. Center frame, a cruel crown of thorns floats against a dark background, radiating sharp, painful light. Beneath it, a man struggles under the weight of a massive, rough-hewn wooden cross on a dusty path. At the bottom, a dramatic, torn veil of ornate temple fabric hangs rent from top to bottom, revealing a blinding divine light beyond. The style is painterly and atmospheric, with a limited palette of deep blues, earthy browns, and stark highlights, evoking a sense of profound narrative and sacred mystery."
