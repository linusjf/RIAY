### AI-Generated Summary: On the Concluding of a Journey with Thanks Given and the Five Glorious Mysteries Named in Their Order - Day 365

My own poor song of thanks must now be joined to that greater one, the Magnificat, wherein she gave thanks for what was done and for what was yet to be. It is rather like the small offering of the boy with his loaves and fishes; a little thing given over, which was then multiplied beyond reckoning. And we have the promise about giving and good measure. For this, thanks must be given to Him, and thanks also for the gift of that mother.

Then come the five Glorious Mysteries to be contemplated. The first is the Resurrection. The second is the Ascension. The third is the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The fourth is the Assumption of Mary. The fifth is the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth. And so, with these prayers, we take our leave.
