  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent concept art illustration in a cohesive vertical composition, depicting the five sorrowful mysteries of the Passion. At the top, Christ kneels in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, an angel offering comfort, with stylized droplets like blood-sweat falling onto olive leaves. Below, He is shown bound to a pillar during the Scourging, the brutal lashes rendered with dynamic, painful lines. Central is the Crowning with Thorns, a close-up of Christ's face in resigned majesty, the sharp thorn crown pressing into his scalp, a purple robe draped over his shoulders. Beneath this, the Carrying of the Cross shows Christ stumbling under its weight, meeting the sorrowful gaze of the Virgin Mary, with Simon of Cyrene aiding from behind. The base of the image portrays the Crucifixion at Golgotha, Christ on the cross between two thieves, his side pierced, with a torn temple veil in the background. The overall style is influenced by the emotive linework and solemn color palette of sacred iconography and Studio Ghibli's atmospheric depth, focusing on clear, anatomically correct expressions of sorrow, sacrifice, and love. The composition flows as a single, unified meditation."
