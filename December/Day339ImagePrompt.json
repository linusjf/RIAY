  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych-style illustration in the spirit of illuminated manuscripts and classical sacred art. The composition is divided into five vertical panels, each depicting a key moment from a Sorrowful Mystery as described through a famous painting. From left to right: 1) Christ in prayer in a dawn-lit Gethsemane (inspired by Bellini), with an angel descending. 2) The geometric, still scene of the Flagellation (inspired by Piero della Francesca). 3) The Crowning with Thorns focusing on Christ's patient face (inspired by Titian). 4) A small, steadfast Christ carrying the cross amid a vast, teeming landscape (inspired by Bruegel). 5) The Crucifixion, a pale, noble figure against a dark void (inspired by Velázquez). The style blends detailed, anatomically faithful figures with a cohesive, solemn color palette of dawn golds, earthy tones, and profound shadows, creating a unified narrative of sacred sacrifice."
