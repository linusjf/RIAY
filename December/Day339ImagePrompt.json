  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych-style digital painting depicting five small, detailed vignettes of the Sorrowful Mysteries, each rendered in the distinct artistic style of the referenced master: Bellini's dawn-lit agony, della Francesca's geometric flagellation, Caravaggio's dramatic chiaroscuro crowning, El Greco's elongated and mystical carrying of the cross, and Grünewald's harrowing crucifixion. The scenes are arranged on aged, gilded panels with subtle cracks, unified by a somber, devotional atmosphere. The lighting is soft and museum-like, highlighting the texture of paint and wood, with each figure's anatomy and expression rendered with profound emotional weight and anatomical faithfulness in their respective historical styles."
