  "image_prompt": "A detailed fresco painting in the style of Italian Renaissance art, depicting the Assumption of Mary. The Virgin Mary, with a serene and graceful expression, is being lifted heavenward on a bank of clouds, surrounded by a host of adoring cherubs and angels. Directly beneath her, one particular cherub, with a determined yet gentle demeanor, uses a slender lance or spear to subdue a small, serpentine dragon. The composition is balanced and luminous, with soft celestial light illuminating the central figures against the deeper blues and golds of the church interior's architectural frame. The artwork conveys a sense of divine triumph, purity, and sacred movement."
