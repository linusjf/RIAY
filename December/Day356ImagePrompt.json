  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, illuminated manuscript-style triptych depicting five sequential scenes of the Joyful Mysteries. Left panel: A detailed Northern Renaissance-style interior where the Archangel Gabriel kneels before Mary; golden rays of light stream through a Gothic window, and Latin script flows from his mouth towards her, while her reply is inscribed upside-down, ascending towards a heavenly light. Central panel, top: A Visitation scene in a sun-drenched Italian landscape, with Mary embracing Elizabeth, and a protective Joseph standing watchfully nearby with a staff. Central panel, bottom: A Nativity scene in a stable, with Joseph shielding Mary and the Christ Child as humble shepherds and regal Magi approach. Right panel, top: The Presentation in the Temple, showing the aged Simeon prophesying to Mary, whose expression holds a poignant mixture of joy and foreknowledge. Right panel, bottom: The Finding in the Temple, depicting Mary and Joseph discovering the young Jesus among the scholars, their faces illuminated by a soft, mysterious light that suggests gradual revelation. The overall style is intricate and layered, with influences from Flemish masters and Italian Renaissance frescoes, ensuring clear, anatomically correct figures and expressive, visible hands."
