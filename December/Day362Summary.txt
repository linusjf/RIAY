### AI-Generated Summary: A Meditation on the Five Glorious Mysteries Concerning Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, Assumption, and Coronation - Day 362

Now, consider the first of these mysteries, the Resurrection. The text invites you to imagine yourself at the empty tomb and to hear the risen Lord Himself speak the words, "Do not be afraid."

The second mystery is the Ascension. Here, the reflection turns to the "great joy" of the apostles, as it is described in the Gospel of Luke.

Then comes the third, the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The focus is placed upon the awe which fell upon all, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, and a prayer is made for an increase of that very awe.

The fourth mystery is the Assumption of Mary. The prayer is simply to experience joy at Mary's share in the victory of her Son.

Finally, the fifth mystery is the Coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth. The encouragement is given to pray to Mary under those titles—Queen and Mother—and to ask for her intercession.

Throughout this meditation, certain repeated prayers form its structure: the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Glory Be, and concluding prayers which include the Hail Holy Queen.
