  "caption": "A series of five luminous mysteries unfolds through sacred art and scripture, depicting pivotal moments from Christ's ministry.",
  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych-style illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscripts and Loish's expressive linework, depicting five central scenes in a cohesive panoramic layout. From left to right: 1) John baptizing Jesus in the Jordan River, with a beam of light and a dove descending from parted clouds. 2) The wedding at Cana, showing Jesus and Mary near large stone jars, with water visibly transforming into wine. 3) Jesus preaching on a hillside to a diverse crowd, with a healed leper kneeling gratefully at His feet, inspired by Tissot's detail. 4) The Transfiguration on a mountain peak, with Jesus radiant between Moses and Elijah, and Peter, James, and John awestruck below. 5) The Last Supper, focusing on Jesus instituting the Eucharist with bread and wine, subtly linked to a scene of Him washing a disciple's feet. All figures have anatomically correct, expressive faces and hands, with five distinct fingers. The composition uses warm, luminous colors and flowing lines to unify the narrative."
