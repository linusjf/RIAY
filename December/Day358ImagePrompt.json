  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-style historical painting in the manner of Diego Velázquez, depicting the Coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth. The scene is a majestic, cloud-filled celestial court. All three persons of the Holy Trinity are present and engaged in the act of coronation. God the Father, an elder figure with a white beard, holds a golden crown. Jesus Christ, the Son, stands beside Him, placing a hand on the crown with a gesture of blessing. The Holy Spirit is manifested as a radiant dove, hovering above Mary with wings outspread, emanating golden light. Mary, depicted as a young woman in humble yet glorious robes, kneels gracefully on a cloud, her hands clasped in prayer, her face turned upward in serene acceptance and devotion. The composition is balanced and hierarchical, with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting highlighting the sacred figures against a deep, atmospheric sky filled with cherubs and soft, glowing clouds. The anatomy, fabrics, and expressions are rendered with realistic, painterly detail and profound emotional gravity."
