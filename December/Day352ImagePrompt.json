  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration depicting the five Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary as a cohesive, illuminated path. The scene is set within a quiet, chapel-like space with soft, radiant light. From left to right, five distinct vignettes flow together: 1) John baptizing Jesus in the Jordan River under a dove's light, 2) Jesus and Mary at the Wedding at Cana with stone water jars, 3) Jesus preaching on a hill under a radiant sky, 4) the Transfiguration on a mountaintop with brilliant light and figures of Moses and Elijah, and 5) a simple, glowing chalice and host on an altar. The composition uses a warm, harmonious color palette with influences from stained glass and illuminated manuscripts, creating a sense of peaceful, sequential meditation. Anatomically correct, gentle figures with expressive, faithful faces and hands guide the viewer through the narrative."
