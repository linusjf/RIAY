  "image_prompt": "A warm, intimate, and stylized illustration in the spirit of Loish or Studio Ghibli concept art. The scene is a cozy, slightly messy living room at dusk, lit by the soft glow of a table lamp and a few candles on a home altar. A diverse family is gathered on a rug: a mother and father sit with rosaries in hand, their expressions peaceful but slightly weary, gently redirecting a fidgeting child. Two other children are present—one leans against the father, half-listening, while a toddler plays quietly with a wooden toy. A vase of roses (white, yellow, and red) sits on a windowsill, their colors symbolizing the mysteries of the rosary. The perspective is slightly elevated, looking down into the room, emphasizing the feeling of a sacred, protected space within the domestic chaos. The faces and hands of all figures are clearly visible and anatomically correct, with natural, tender postures. The overall mood is one of persevering love, quiet sacrifice, and luminous grace woven into ordinary life."
