  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized concept art illustration in the manner of luminous Renaissance frescoes and Baroque drama. The scene is a cohesive, unified triptych or polyptych altarpiece visualizing the Five Glorious Mysteries. From left to right: 1) The Resurrection, showing Christ in a pose of serene victory, stepping from a stone tomb over sleeping Roman soldiers, holding a slender banner, inspired by Piero della Francesca's geometric clarity. 2) The Ascension, with Christ's feet disappearing into a vortex of radiant clouds, the apostles gazing upward from below. 3) Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary at the center of a gathered group, tongues of fire descending upon them in a dynamic Baroque composition reminiscent of Restout. 4) The Assumption, with Mary being borne aloft by angels into a heavenly glow, her robes flowing gracefully. 5) The Coronation, where Mary is crowned by the figures of the Holy Trinity amidst celestial glory. All figures have anatomically correct, expressive faces and hands. The overall style blends Early Renaissance tempera texture with the dramatic lighting of Caravaggio, creating a spatially coherent and spiritually elevated panoramic vision."
