  "image_prompt": "A stylized cartoon illustration in the manner of sacred illuminated manuscripts and Studio Ghibli's ethereal beauty, showing five interconnected circular vignettes on a heavenly gold-leaf background. 1) The Resurrection: Christ emerges from a radiant tomb at dawn, a brilliant Paschal candle beside Him, His expression serene and victorious. 2) The Ascension: Jesus ascends on a cloud from the Mount of Olives, His disciples below looking up with awe, His hands extended in blessing. 3) Pentecost: The Upper Room with the Virgin Mary and Apostles, each crowned with a distinct tongue of fire, a dynamic wind stirring their robes. 4) The Assumption: Mary, borne by gentle angels, is lifted on a crescent moon into a burst of celestial light and joyful angelic hosts. 5) The Coronation: The Holy Trinity crowns Mary as Queen; she sits enthroned amidst stars, holding a sceptre, with orderly ranks of angels (*Regina Angelorum*) bowing around her. The composition is spatially coherent, with flowing lines connecting the mysteries. All human figures have anatomically correct, expressive faces and clearly visible hands with five distinct fingers, postures are natural and reverent. The overall palette is luminous with gold, azure, and white, conveying divine glory and peaceful triumph."
