    "image_prompt": "A stylized, serene illustration in the manner of a devotional manuscript or altarpiece, showing a symbolic path through five arched windows. Each window frames a different, simplified yet majestic scene: a triumphant Christ rising from a tomb, Christ ascending into clouds with apostles below, the Holy Spirit descending as fiery light upon gathered figures, the Virgin Mary being assumed into heaven by jubilant angels, and Mary being crowned by divine figures in a golden space. The composition is balanced and reverent, with a soft, heavenly light unifying all five panels, influenced by the delicate detail and spiritual atmosphere of early Renaissance tempera painting and Studio Ghibli's sense of awe."
