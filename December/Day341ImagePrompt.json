  "image_prompt": "A stylized, serene illustration in the spirit of illuminated manuscripts and fresco art, depicting a symbolic path winding through five arched windows. Each window frames a different, softly glowing scene: a radiant figure rising before sleeping guards, a figure ascending into a burst of light, a dove radiating beams over gathered figures, a woman borne aloft by angels, and a coronation amidst a celestial host. The style blends the ethereal light of Fra Angelico with the compositional clarity of Piero della Francesca, rendered as a cohesive, detailed concept art piece. The perspective leads the viewer's eye along the path, with all figures, hands, and faces depicted with anatomically correct, graceful proportions."
