  "image_prompt": "A detailed, reverent painting in the style of James Tisseau's sacred art, depicting the view from the cross at the moment of crucifixion. The perspective is from the cross, looking down and outward. In the foreground, the rough, blood-stained wood of the crossbeam is visible. Below, the figure of the Virgin Mary is seen looking up, her face a mixture of profound sorrow, love, and acceptance, rendered with exquisite emotional detail. Behind her, a crowd of indistinct, mingled faces—some mocking, some grieving—recedes into the dusty atmosphere of Golgotha. The lighting is dramatic, with a heavenly glow contrasting the earthly gloom, emphasizing the theological weight of the scene with masterful chiaroscuro. The composition is spatially coherent, directing the viewer's eye from the immediate physical reality of the cross to the spiritual significance of the figures below."
