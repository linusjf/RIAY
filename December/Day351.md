### AI-Generated Summary: On the Five Glorious Mysteries and the Private Resurrection, the Longing Ascension, the Spirit's Descent with Peter's Keys, Mary's Assumption, and Her Coronation Through Humility - Day 351

Now, consider the five Glorious Mysteries. The first is the Resurrection, which is described not as a public spectacle but as a private and secret event, a matter solely between Jesus and the Father. The second is the Ascension, an event that rightly stirs within us a profound longing for heaven. The third is the descent of the Holy Spirit; here we are told of a painting by Titian depicting Pentecost, in which Peter is shown holding keys. The text recounts, too, the failures of Peter and his subsequent transformation. The fourth is the Assumption of Mary, wherein she was taken, body and soul, into heaven. The fifth and final mystery is the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Earth, a crown she achieved not by conquest but through humility.
