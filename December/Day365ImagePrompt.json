  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the spirit of sacred manuscript illumination and Studio Ghibli's ethereal beauty. The scene is divided: on the lower left, a small, humble figure offers a tiny basket with five loaves and two fish, their gesture meek and sincere. From this offering, golden light radiates upward, transforming into a grand, celestial vision above. In the upper portion, five glowing, symbolic vignettes for the Glorious Mysteries are arranged in a gentle arc: a radiant dawn for the Resurrection, a figure ascending into light for the Ascension, descending tongues of flame for Pentecost, a woman being assumed into a starry sky for the Assumption, and a crowned queen seated among clouds and stars for the Coronation. The overall palette is warm, with deep blues, golds, and soft whites, creating a cohesive and spatially coherent composition that connects earthly humility with divine glory. All humanoid forms are depicted with natural, anatomically faithful postures and clearly visible, detailed faces and hands."
