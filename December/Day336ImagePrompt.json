  "image_prompt": "A stylized, luminous illustration in the spirit of Loish or Studio Ghibli concept art, depicting a delicate, ethereal crown of roses floating against a soft, textured background. The roses transition in color and form through the mysteries: pristine white buds (Joyful), bright yellow blossoms bursting with light (Luminous), deep red roses with hints of shadow and thorn (Sorrowful), and glorious white roses edged in radiant gold and crimson (Glorious). The crown is not static; subtle, glowing particles of grace drift from its petals. Below, in soft focus, a small, messy, and loving family scene is hinted at—silhouettes of figures gathered, a child's hand reaching—blending seamlessly into the same light emanating from the crown. The perspective is intimate and slightly from above, focusing on the crown as the central, cohesive symbol, with perfect anatomical detail in any suggested hands and faces, all rendered with warm, harmonious colors and a sense of deep peace and enduring promise."
