    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the manner of sacred iconography and the emotive clarity of artists like El Greco and Caravaggio. The composition is a cohesive triptych of sorrow and consolation. On the left, a figure kneels in a moonlit garden, bathed in a supernatural, sorrowful light while companions sleep in shadow. The center depicts a stark, geometric scene of judicial violence, next to a dark room where a resigned figure is crowned with thorns by brutal hands under torchlight. On the right, a small, burdened figure is nearly lost in a vast, indifferent landscape procession, leading the eye to a harrowing yet sacred crucifixion on a hill, where the broken form speaks of shared suffering. The overall lighting is dramatic, contrasting celestial illumination with earthly darkness, weaving the five mysteries into a single narrative of agony that holds a silent promise of redemption."
