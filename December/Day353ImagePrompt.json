  "image_prompt": "A stylized, emotionally resonant illustration in the vein of Studio Ghibli's spiritual depth and Glen Keane's expressive linework. The scene depicts a powerful synthesis: on the left, the sorrowful figure of Christ carries his cross along a dusty path, his posture weary yet resolute. On the right, in a parallel landscape of green fields, the silhouette of a father is seen running with arms outstretched toward a distant, returning figure. The two scenes are connected by a beam of divine light from a cross on a hill, which also illuminates the father's face, revealing a love that is both sorrowful and pursuing. The composition is geometrically sound with a clear vanishing point, and the characters' hands and faces are anatomically clear and full of poignant expression."
