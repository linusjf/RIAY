    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the tradition of illuminated manuscripts and frescoes, depicting the five Glorious Mysteries as a unified spiritual journey. In the foreground, a radiant, empty tomb in a garden at dawn. Above, Christ ascends into a luminous sky, His hands raised in eternal blessing. From the heavens, tongues of fire descend upon a gathering of diverse, hopeful figures in an Upper Room. Central to the composition, the Virgin Mary is assumed into a cloud of glory, her form graceful and peaceful. Crowning the scene, she is enthroned as Queen of Heaven, wearing a stellar crown, surrounded by celestial light and adoring angels, all pointing toward a vision of a radiant, promised heavenly city on the horizon. The style is cohesive, with flowing lines, rich symbolic colors, and a sense of sacred narrative progression."
