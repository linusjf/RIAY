  "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent concept art illustration depicting five arched doorways or windows in a celestial stone wall, each glowing with a different dawn light. Through the first doorway, a serene figure steps from a tomb at sunrise. In the second, a luminous figure ascends with hands raised in blessing. The third is filled with vibrant, rushing tongues of flame. The fourth shows a figure being borne aloft by angelic hosts. The fifth reveals a coronation in heavenly glory. The style blends the anatomical faithfulness and expressive elongation of artists like El Greco with the serene composition of Piero della Francesca and the rich color of Titian, creating a cohesive and spiritually evocative narrative scene. All figures have clearly visible, anatomically correct faces and hands with five distinct fingers."
