    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent triptych-style illustration depicting five key scenes from the Joyful Mysteries. On the left, the Angel Gabriel appears before Mary in a sunlit room, rays of divine light breaking through a window. In the center, Mary visits Elizabeth in a vibrant countryside, their hands clasped with a visible glow of grace between them; nearby, Joseph leads a donkey carrying Mary toward a distant Bethlehem under a starry sky. On the right, the Holy Family is presented in the temple, with the aged Simeon holding the infant Jesus aloft, his face radiant. In the background, a young Jesus is seen teaching among scholars in the temple. The art style is detailed and warm, influenced by the luminous color palettes and graceful linework of Studio Ghibli, with anatomically correct figures and expressive, peaceful faces. The composition flows seamlessly, using architectural elements and natural landscapes to connect the scenes in a single, coherent narrative image."
