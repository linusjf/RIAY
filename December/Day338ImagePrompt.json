    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the tradition of illuminated manuscripts and sacred art, depicting five circular vignettes arranged in a gentle arc. From left to right: 1) Christ standing in the Jordan River, water flowing around Him, a dove descending from parted clouds with a beam of light. 2) The wedding at Cana, with Christ gesturing towards large stone jars, their contents glowing with a deep, ruby light, and Mary nearby. 3) Christ preaching from a small boat on a turbulent sea, His hand raised in a calming gesture towards stylized, worried faces of the disciples. 4) The Transfiguration on a mountain peak, Christ radiant with light, with the figures of Moses and Elijah beside Him, and three awestruck disciples below. 5) The Last Supper, Christ offering bread and a chalice that emanates a soft, golden light to His gathered apostles. The overall style is detailed, with warm, luminous colors, delicate gold leaf accents, and a sense of serene, narrative flow connecting the scenes."
