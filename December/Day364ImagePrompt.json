    "image_prompt": "A stylized, reverent illustration in the manner of illuminated manuscript art blended with the emotive clarity of Studio Ghibli. The scene shows a single, open prayer book resting on a worn wooden surface. From its pages, five distinct, softly glowing vignettes emerge like ethereal smoke, each depicting a Sorrowful Mystery: Christ in agony at Gethsemane, the scourging at the pillar, the crowning with thorns, the carrying of the cross, and the crucifixion. The vignettes are arranged in a gentle arc above the book, connected by delicate, glowing lines of prayer. The lighting is warm and dim, focused on the book and the visions, creating a deep sense of quiet meditation and sacred narrative. The style is detailed yet soft, with anatomically correct figures in each small scene expressing profound emotion and solemnity."
