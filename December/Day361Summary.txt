### AI-Generated Summary: A Consideration of the Five Joyful Mysteries Concerning the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Presentation, and Finding in the Temple - Day 361

Now, let us consider these five mysteries, which are called Joyful. The first is the Annunciation, where we are given the angel's words: "For with God, nothing will be impossible." The second is the Visitation, where we hear of a recognition of a "low estate" and of "limits." The third is the Nativity, which invites one to imagine a mother holding her infant child. The fourth is the Presentation in the temple, where we are told of a persevering, watchful prayer described as a "silent cry." The fifth is the Finding in the temple, describing a moment where a child was lost and then found, which led to a deeper revelation. The meditation concludes with several closing prayers.
