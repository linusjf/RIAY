  "image_prompt": "A richly detailed, stylized cartoon illustration in the manner of sacred concept art, showing a cohesive circular composition representing the Five Glorious Mysteries. At the center is a radiant, empty tomb for the Resurrection. Radiating outwards are scenes: Christ ascending with Gandino-inspired footprints below for the Ascension; a dove descending upon praying figures for Pentecost; the Assumption of Mary into a starry heaven; and a final coronation where Christ crowns Mary as Queen. The style is influenced by the flowing lines and emotive clarity of Studio Ghibli and Glen Keane, with warm, luminous colors. All figures are shown with natural, anatomically correct postures and clearly visible, detailed faces and hands with five distinct fingers each. The overall perspective is slightly elevated, looking down into the unified, geometrically balanced mandala of scenes, surrounded by subtle motifs of rosary beads and light."
