  "image_prompt": "A stylized cartoon illustration in the manner of gentle, luminous concept art, showing five interconnected circular vignettes representing the Joyful Mysteries. From left to right: 1) The Annunciation, with the Archangel Gabriel before a reverent Mary, light streaming through a window. 2) The Visitation, showing Mary and Elizabeth embracing in a sun-drenched garden. 3) The Nativity, a serene mother Mary holding the infant Jesus in a humble stable, with soft glowing light. 4) The Presentation, with Simeon holding the child in the temple, his face etched with awe. 5) The Finding in the Temple, showing the young Jesus teaching among scholars, with Mary and Joseph watching from the doorway. The composition is spatially coherent, with a flowing ribbon connecting the scenes. All human figures have anatomically correct, expressive faces and clearly visible hands with five distinct fingers, rendered in a warm, painterly style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's quiet moments."
