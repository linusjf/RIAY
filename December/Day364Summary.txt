### AI-Generated Summary: A Guided Prayer Through the Five Sorrowful Mysteries Beginning with an Invocation and Concluding with Petitions - Day 364

Now, my dear reader, let us walk together through this guided prayer. It begins, as all true things must, with an invocation.

We consider first the agony in the garden. Here we are shown a model: how one brings sorrow to the Father.

We turn next to the scourging at the pillar. This is presented to us as nothing less than a sign—a sign of a love that declares the value of a thing.

The third mystery is the crowning with thorns. We are asked to picture it: the crown of thorns, the purple robe, the reed held in the hand. We see the mockery and the spitting. And from this picture, we are drawn to make a prayer of our own to this King.

Then comes the carrying of the cross. The emphasis here rests upon a perseverance that seeks and does not cease from seeking.

Finally, we stand at the crucifixion. We hear the words from the cross—words to a mother and to a disciple. And from this event, a single interpretation is offered: that a mother is given to all.

And so the prayer concludes. It recites the familiar words: the Hail Mary, the Glory Be, the Fatima Prayer, the Hail Holy Queen. It ends with a closing prayer, and there it rests.
