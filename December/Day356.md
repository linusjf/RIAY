### AI-Generated Summary: On the Depiction of the Annunciation and the Five Joyful Mysteries Concerning the Blessed Virgin Mary - Day 356

Now, consider the detail in Van Eyck's depiction of the Annunciation. The angel's words are written for the viewer to read, but Mary's response is written upside down. This communicates that she is speaking directly to God. It is a beautiful artistic way to show that Mary, like her Son, experiences life in relationship with God.

The second joyful mystery is named the Visitation. There is a painting of this Visitation by Federico Maldarelli, and in it, Joseph is included. One may speculate that Joseph was present on the journey for the purpose of caring for and protecting Mary.

The third joyful mystery is named the Nativity. Here we may reflect on the role of Saint Joseph in being present to protect Mary, thereby making it safe for shepherds and Magi to visit.

The fourth joyful mystery is named the presentation of Jesus in the temple. We are told of Simeon's prophecy that a sword will pierce Mary's heart. This reveals more of what her initial "yes" will cost, and it is said that Mary says a deeper "yes" again.

The fifth joyful mystery is named the finding of Jesus in the temple. In this, Mary, like all believers, was on a pilgrimage of faith where things were not immediately clear but were revealed over time. She was, we are told, comfortable with mystery.
