### AI-Generated Summary: The Unconquerable Love in the Scourging of Christ

Behold a fresco, wrought by the hand of Augustinino Gian Pelli, where our Lord stands bound to the pillar, His body yet unbroken, His halo a quiet defiance against the gathering cruelty. The artist, a Florentine laboring in Rome, has fixed in pigment that dreadful moment before the lash falls—the soldiers coiled like serpents, the onlookers half-turned away, as men often do when faced with the suffering they will not stay.

Here is the Lamb, whole and holy, wrapped in the white of innocence, His flesh soon to be torn asunder. Yet mark this: though the scourge will strip Him of comeliness, it cannot strip Him of glory. Pilate, that vacillating judge, will afterward display Him to the mob, thinking their rage might be satisfied with broken skin and spilt blood. But the world’s hatred is never so easily spent. They cry for the cross, blind to the radiance that no brutality can dim.

And here lies the great mystery—that in His wounds, we see our healing; in His weakness, our strength. As St. Paul writes, neither anguish nor peril, neither the lash nor the nail, can sever us from the love of God. For Christ, even in His Passion, is still the Way, the Truth, and the Life. His love is a fortress that no assault of sin or death can overthrow.

Let us then, with the Blessed Mother, say, _Hail Mary, full of grace_, and with the Church, _Glory be to the Father_, for in these sorrows we find the very heart of joy.
