  "image_prompt": "An ancient basilica with towering arches and domed ceilings, illuminated by the warm glow of countless golden mosaics. The central apse depicts Christ in celestial blue robes, holding the wooden cross, surrounded by adoring angels with outstretched wings. Below, John the Baptist kneels in reverence, and the Virgin Mary bows in humble prayer, her hands clasped. The walls shimmer with intricate tesserae, blending Byzantine, Florentine, and Venetian artistry, creating a heavenly radiance that draws the eye upward. Soft candlelight flickers across the sacred scene, casting a reverent stillness over the space."
