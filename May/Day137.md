### AI-Generated Summary: The Radiance of Divine Light in the Transfiguration Window

The stained glass window of the Transfiguration in Vienna’s Votive Church is a luminous testament to Christ’s divine nature. At its heart stands Jesus, ablaze with unearthly light, flanked by Moses and Elijah—figures of the Law and the Prophets—while below, the apostles Peter, James, and John gaze upward in wonder. The artist (unknown) employs rich hues, yet Christ’s brilliance dominates, a visual echo of His declaration: _I am the light of the world_. The church itself, a neo-Gothic marvel by Heinrich von Ferstel (completed 1879), frames this masterpiece, where glass and light conspire to reveal sacred truth.

Here, the Transfiguration is no mere event but a revelation: Christ, the _sun at noonday_, unveils the glory that the Law and Prophets—like dawn—could only foreshadow. The window’s very medium speaks of grace; as sunlight transforms stained glass into a tapestry of fire, so divine illumination reveals meaning in what was once opaque. The apostles, trembling at the sight, embody our own frailty before such radiance—yet also our hope. For to behold this light is to be warmed, clarified, and remade.

The accompanying prayers—_Our Father_, _Hail Mary_, _Glory Be_—are not mere recitations but echoes of that moment on the mount. They are petitions for the very light the window depicts: forgiveness to cleanse, guidance to steady, and grace to transfigure our own shadows into clarity. The closing blessing is no formality but a whispered promise: that the same light which once dazzled the apostles still pierces the dimness of our world, if we have eyes to see.

In this fusion of art and devotion, the window becomes more than decoration; it is a summons. Like the apostles, we are called to witness, to kneel, and—in time—to reflect.
