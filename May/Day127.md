### AI-Generated Summary: The Joy of Heavenly Reunion and Earthly Devotion

- **Mary’s Assumption and St. Bernard’s Sermon**\
  The Assumption of Mary is not merely doctrine but a celestial celebration. St. Bernard of Clairvaux depicts heaven’s delight at her arrival, as she bridges the divine and human realms. Her mercy, power, and holiness—rooted in her motherhood of Christ—invite spiritual reflection.

- **Mother Teresa’s Homecoming as an Earthly Parallel**\
  A documentary captures Mother Teresa’s return to her convent, where novices greet her with radiant joy. This mirrors the Assumption: a reunion suffused with love, not abstraction. The scene embodies the holiness of presence, much like Mary’s welcome into heaven.

- **From Theology to Heartfelt Longing**\
  St. Bernard’s words frame Mary’s Assumption as a foretaste of resurrection hope. The text urges a shift from intellectual assent to visceral devotion—yearning to hear Mary’s voice, feel her embrace, and share in eternal joy through the Spirit’s grace.

- **Prayer as the Soul’s Response**\
  Repeated prayers (“Hail Mary,” “Glory Be”) anchor the reflection, transforming longing into liturgy. The closing blessing underscores devotion as both personal and communal, a rhythm of love echoing heaven’s joy.
