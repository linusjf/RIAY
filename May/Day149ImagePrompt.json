  "image_prompt": "A barefoot young woman sitting on an unmade bed in a simple, modest room. Her face is softly lit with a mix of awe and trepidation, her hands slightly trembling as she gazes upward. A warm, golden light streams into the room from an unseen source, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of the rough-hewn walls and rumpled bedding. The atmosphere is intimate and sacred, capturing a moment of quiet revelation and profound humility."
