### AI-Generated Summary: James Tissot’s Healing of the Lepers at Capernaum and the Kingdom of God

James Tissot, a French artist known for merging impressionism and realism, shifted from secular subjects to religious themes after his return to Catholicism. His painting _Healing of the Lepers at Capernaum_ captures a moment of divine intervention: a leper kneels on cobblestones, reaching toward a group that includes a figure in white—presumably Christ—touching a child’s head. Light falls on a nearby house, while shadows drape the street, visually underscoring the contrast between despair and hope, suffering and healing.

The work reflects the biblical narrative where Christ heals ten lepers, yet only one returns to give thanks. This omission of gratitude becomes a parable of human frailty—divine grace is freely given, but it demands a response. The "kingdom of God" is not a static realm but God’s active presence: teaching, saving, and restoring. Tissot’s composition, with its interplay of light and shadow, mirrors this tension between divine offer and human reception.

True faith, the passage argues, is more than passive belief; it requires worship, obedience, and trust. Gratitude is the heartbeat of repentance, a surrender to God’s guidance. The text closes with repeated prayers—the _Hail Mary_, invoking Mary’s intercession, and the _Glory Be_, praising the Trinity—emphasizing dependence on mercy and the communal nature of devotion.

In sum, Tissot’s painting and the accompanying meditation weave art and theology into a call to action: to receive grace with humility, to repent with hope, and to answer divine light with human gratitude.
