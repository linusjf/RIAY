  "image_prompt": "A Baroque-style painting inspired by Vel√°zquez, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. She sits gracefully on a throne of clouds, draped in flowing robes of deep purple and celestial blue, her hands folded in humility. Above her, God the Father, an elderly figure with a long white beard, and Christ, a younger man with a serene expression, gently place a delicate crown of roses upon her head. Between them, the Holy Spirit in the form of a radiant dove hovers, its wings outstretched, emanating golden light. Cherubs with soft, rosy cheeks and tiny wings flutter around the scene, some playing harps, others gazing in adoration. The background is a luminous sky, filled with golden rays and ethereal mist, evoking a sense of divine glory and sacred union. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence, love, and heavenly celebration."
