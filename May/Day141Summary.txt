### AI-Generated Summary: The Suffering King and the Call to Repentance  

Behold Titian’s *Christ Crowned with Thorns*, where the divine meets the cruelty of men. Here stands our Lord, robed in rose, His body noble as the sculpted heroes of old, yet bowed under the mockery of those who know not what they do. Behind Him, cold and unfeeling, looms the bust of Tiberius—earthly power, blind to the true King who suffers before it.  

See how the thorns are pressed deeper by a wooden pole, a small but piercing detail. It is not merely a painting of long-past violence; it is a mirror. In every act of indifference, in every preference for the world’s empty crowns over His love, in every distrust of His mercy—we too press the thorns upon His brow. The soldiers’ hands are ours.  

Yet here also is grace, if we will have it. To sorrow for our sins is to share in His suffering rightly, not as tormentors but as penitents. Let us ask, then, for the tears that cleanse and the strength to turn away when temptation whispers. For only by kneeling before the crucified can we rise unshackled.  

*Hail Mary, full of grace... Glory be to the Father...* So we pray, again and again, that our hearts may learn what our lips repeat. And may He, who bore the thorns for love of us, grant us peace. Amen.
