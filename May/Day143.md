### AI-Generated Summary: The Rainbow and the Cross

Behold a vision of the Cross, painted not with the harsh strokes of despair, but with the tender hues of hope. There hangs the Saviour, His arms outstretched as if to gather all the world’s sorrows into Himself, while behind Him arcs a rainbow—God’s ancient pledge of mercy, now fulfilled in this greater covenant of blood and love. The sky is dark with the storm of sin, yet golden light breaks through, and angels hover near, witnesses to the divine drama unfolding.

Two thieves flank Him: one bathed in the light of repentance, the other lost in shadow—a stark reminder that even at the hour of death, the choice between heaven and hell remains. Below, the faithful weep: His mother, the beloved disciple, the mourning women. And round about, the world looks on—some in mockery, some in awe, all caught in the moment where eternity pierces time.

Here is the paradox of the Cross: in suffering, victory; in death, life; in darkest grief, the dawn of unending joy. The rainbow, once a sign of God’s promise to Noah, now crowns the Crucified, declaring that no storm lasts forever, no night is without morning. Let those who suffer take heart—the arms that stretched to complete the bow of heaven’s covenant will one day wipe away every tear.

And so we pray, not as those without hope, but as children who know their Father keeps His word. _Hail Mary, full of grace... Glory be to the Father..._ For in the end, all shall be well, and all shall be well, and every manner of thing shall be well.
