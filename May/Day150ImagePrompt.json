  "image_prompt": "A Renaissance-style painting depicting Mary, dressed in flowing rose and teal robes, her eyes lifted with a serene yet knowing expression, standing before Elizabeth, who bends slightly in reverence. Joseph and Zachariah stand in the background, Joseph with a humble, protective stance, his hands clasped in quiet devotion. The scene is bathed in soft, golden light, evoking a sense of divine presence and sacred stillness. The composition is rich with symbolic detailsâ€”subtle halos, delicate folds of fabric, and a landscape suggesting a journey through rolling hills. The atmosphere is one of quiet majesty, where human faithfulness mirrors heavenly grace."
