  "image_prompt": "A dimly lit stable with a wooden manger at the center, where the Christ Child lies wrapped in swaddling clothes, bathed in a soft, golden glow. Mary, young and serene, kneels beside the manger, her hands clasped in prayer. Saint Joseph stands protectively behind her, his strong carpenterâ€™s frame casting a gentle shadow. His expression is one of quiet devotion, his eyes reflecting both weariness and unwavering faith. Shepherds kneel in reverence nearby, their faces awestruck. The atmosphere is hushed, filled with a sense of divine presence, as if Heaven has touched earth in this sacred moment. The scene is painted in warm, earthy tones with subtle celestial light filtering through the wooden beams above."
