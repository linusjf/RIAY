### AI-Generated Summary: The Duality of Judas and the Mercy of Christ

Consider the painting by Masip, where our Lord kneels in Gethsemane, His sorrow etched with divine realism. An angel descends to strengthen Him, while His chosen three slumber, heavy with human frailty. Yet it is Judas who arrests the eye—his halo half gold, half black, as if the artist wished to show us that even in betrayal, the soul teeters between light and shadow. Here is a truth both terrible and tender: no man is beyond redemption until he refuses it.

Peter, too, betrayed—yet he wept and was restored. Judas, though offered the same mercy, turned inward to despair. The lesson is plain as morning: God’s forgiveness waits, but we must open the door. Christ’s agony in the garden was not merely for nails and thorns, but for hearts that would rather perish than be pardoned.

To the weary soul, this is your comfort: come as you are, but do not stay as you are. The prayers we repeat—the _Hail Mary_, the _Glory Be_—are not incantations but lifelines, thrown across the chasm of our failings. Mercy is always nearer than we dare hope.
