  "image_prompt": "A painting in the style of Carracci depicting the risen Christ at dawn, His figure glowing with divine light, eyes uplifted toward heaven in serene communion with the Father. Behind Him, the sealed tomb stands with the stone still in place, its darkness contrasting with His radiance. A few astonished Roman soldiers are frozen in awe at the edges of the scene, their faces half-lit by the unearthly glow. Angels hover in the background, their adoring gazes fixed on Christ. The landscape is bathed in the soft gold and pink hues of early morning, suggesting both the dawn of a new day and the dawn of redemption. The folds of Christ's burial shroud flow dynamically, as if stirred by a celestial wind, while His hands bear the faint marks of the crucifixion, now transformed into signs of victory."
