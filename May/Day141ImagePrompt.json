  "image_prompt": "A dramatic and emotional painting in the style of Titian, depicting Christ crowned with thorns, robed in rose, His noble form bowed under the weight of mockery. Behind Him looms the cold, unfeeling bust of Tiberius, symbolizing earthly power blind to divine suffering. A wooden pole presses the thorns deeper into His brow, a small yet piercing detail. The scene is rich with chiaroscuro, emphasizing the contrast between divine grace and human cruelty. The expressions of the tormentors are indifferent, their hands symbolic of collective guilt. The composition evokes deep sorrow and a call to penitence, with a soft glow around Christâ€™s face suggesting enduring mercy amidst suffering."
