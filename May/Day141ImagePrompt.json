  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Baroque-style painting depicting Christ crowned with thorns, His head bowed in silent endurance. Five figures surround Him, their hands pressing the thorny circlet into His brow with rough malice. Christ is robed in a flowing rose-colored garment, symbolizing the dawn of mercy, while His expression conveys both agony and divine patience. In the background, a cold, unmoved bust of Tiberius looms, representing hollow earthly power. The composition draws inspiration from the agony of the *Laoco√∂n* and the strength of the *Belvedere Torso*, creating a powerful contrast between divine suffering and human cruelty. A wooden pole deepens the thorns, symbolizing the weight of sin. The lighting is chiaroscuro, with dramatic shadows highlighting Christ's face and the thorns, while the soldiers' mocking expressions are half-hidden in darkness. The scene is both a visceral depiction of suffering and a profound spiritual allegory."
