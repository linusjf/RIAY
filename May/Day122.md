### AI-Generated Summary: The Victory of the Cross in Suffering

The meditation on the fourth sorrowful mystery reveals the cross as a paradox—an instrument of shame transformed into a symbol of triumph. St. Thomas Aquinas underscores this reversal:

- **The Cross as Victory**: Christ’s willing embrace of the cross turned a sign of disgrace into a banner of dominion, conquering evil and radiating divine light.
- **The Paradox of Suffering**: What was meant for humiliation became the means of salvation, proving that God’s power shines through apparent defeat.

The passage extends this truth to personal struggles:

- **Suffering United to Christ**: Hardships remain painful, but when shared with Jesus, they gain redemptive purpose. Alone, suffering is tragic; with Him, it becomes transformative.
- **From Shame to Grace**: Just as Christ’s cross brought glory, our wounds—when surrendered to Him—can become tools for ministry, equipping us to serve others.

Key insights include:

- Faith does not erase pain but infuses it with meaning.
- The cross teaches that victory often wears the guise of defeat.
- Closing prayers (e.g., _Hail Mary_, _Glory Be_) anchor this hope in divine grace, seeking intercession for perseverance.

In brief: the cross is both burden and beacon—a call to carry our trials with Christ, trusting in their hidden triumph.
