### AI-Generated Summary: A Meditation on Mary's Sorrow at the Cross

- **Mary’s Witness**: The crucifixion is portrayed through Mary’s eyes, blending her memory of Jesus as both the infant of Bethlehem and the suffering man of Calvary. Her dual vision sharpens her grief, making her sorrow a lens for deeper contemplation.
- **Brutality of the Cross**: St. Bridget’s _Revelations_ underscores the physical torment—nails piercing flesh, limbs wrenched, veins ruptured—while Mary’s steadfast presence magnifies the horror and holiness of the scene.
- **Devotion’s Paradox**: Mary’s Magnificat, a song of divine glory, contrasts with her anguish at the cross. Her suffering does not diminish Christ’s majesty but reveals its cost, proving that love and sorrow amplify redemption’s weight.
- **Spiritual Invitation**: To meditate on Mary’s perspective is to awaken sharper sorrow for sin, fiercer gratitude for sacrifice, and truer contrition. Her heart becomes a school for the penitent.
- **Prayer as Response**: The repeated _Hail Mary_ and _Glory Be_ are not mere recitations but echoes of Mary’s own surrender, framing the crucifixion within praise and petition. The closing trinitarian formula seals the meditation as both gift and grace.

_In brevity, the text weaves brutality, devotion, and prayer into a tapestry meant to pierce the soul as the nails pierced Christ—through the heart of His mother._
