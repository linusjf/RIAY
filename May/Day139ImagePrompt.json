  "image_prompt": "A dramatic painting-style scene of Christ kneeling in Gethsemane, His face etched with divine sorrow, illuminated by a soft celestial glow. An angel descends from above, radiant with golden light, offering a chalice of strength. Nearby, three apostles sleep in shadow, their postures heavy with exhaustion. At the forefront, Judas stands with a conflicted expression, his halo split—half gleaming gold, half ominous black—symbolizing the duality of his soul. The background is a dark garden with twisted olive trees, their branches reaching like desperate hands. The atmosphere is thick with tension, divine grace, and the weight of impending betrayal."
