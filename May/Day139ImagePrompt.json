  "image_prompt": "A dramatic Renaissance-style painting depicting Christ kneeling in Gethsemane, His face etched with divine sorrow. An angel descends from a luminous sky, offering a golden chalice, while three apostles sleep nearby, their postures heavy with exhaustion. In the foreground, Judas stands with a conflicted expression, his halo split—half radiant gold, half shadowed black—symbolizing the tension between betrayal and redemption. The background is a moonlit garden with twisted olive trees, their branches echoing the anguish of the scene. The composition balances divine light and human frailty, emphasizing the moment before Judas' fateful choice."
