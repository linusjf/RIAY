### Rest in All Things

### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Serenity in the Midst of Betrayal

Here we see, dear reader, a moment both terrible and tender—the Last Supper, rendered in the patient art of mosaic, where the Lord sits at the center, calm as a stilled sea while the tempest of betrayal brews around Him. His disciples, like men caught in a gale, wear faces of confusion, sorrow, even guilt; yet He, knowing all, remains unmoved. Before Him lie the bread and wine, humble tokens of a covenant that would outlast empires.

Consider His peace—not the absence of storm, but the mastery over it. As He once slept in the boat while waves threatened, so now He sits, sovereign over the dark currents of human treachery. The world may rage, but it cannot shake Him; death may loom, but it cannot claim Him. His serenity is no indifference, but the quiet of One who knows the Father’s will and walks it without flinching.

And here lies our lesson: if He, facing the cross, could rest in trust, then why should we, in our lesser trials, fret like orphans? His authority is not diminished by our chaos, nor His love undone by our failures. Repent, believe, and take heart—for the same hands that broke the bread and bore the nails hold all things, even now.

_Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit._
