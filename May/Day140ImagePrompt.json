  "image_prompt": "A fresco-style painting depicting Christ bound to a pillar, His body unbroken but poised for suffering. He wears a radiant halo that contrasts with the shadowy figures of soldiers coiled like serpents, ready to strike with scourges. Onlookers stand half-turned away, their faces a mix of indifference and discomfort. The scene is bathed in dramatic chiaroscuro, with Christ's white robes symbolizing innocence amidst the impending violence. The composition evokes tension and reverence, capturing the moment before the first lash falls."
