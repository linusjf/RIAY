# TODOs

## Features

1. Add script addsummaryimagestodays.
1. Add unit tests using BATS.

## Bugs/Issues

1. Add another search for wikipedia images but this time from wikipedia pages since wikimedia image search is not returning correct images as per description. Don't know the reason, perhaps this data is not available to wikimedia api or labelling is incorrect or research needed for parameters making search more specific. Wikipedia pages search is suggested as an alternative online.

## Exploratory tasks

1. Explore alternate , more economical but possibly less accurate verification process using Google Lens search.
