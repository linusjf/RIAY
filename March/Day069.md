### AI-Generated Summary The Practice of Holy Reading

Friends, let us turn our minds to a venerable path, a way of meeting the Divine Word not merely with the intellect, but with the whole soul. This is the practice known as _Lexio Divina_, a sacred reading of Scripture, which unfolds in four simple yet profound movements:

- **Reading (_Lexio_)**: Here we approach the text prayerfully, allowing God to speak. One reads the passage entire, then perhaps a smaller portion, even a single word, again and again, seeking not just the plain sense, but listening for the whisper meant for _us_, here and now. It is a receiving, a quiet opening of the ear of the heart.
- **Meditation (_Meditatio_)**: Having received, we now engage. This is the time to ponder, to ask questions of the text, to see connections, perhaps even to place ourselves within the scene using our imagination. It is a chewing upon the Word, allowing its flavour to penetrate our being, moving from the head to the heart.
- **Prayer (_Orio_)**: From pondering, we naturally turn to address God Himself. One helpful pattern is the 'Four Rs':
  - **Receive**: Acknowledging the truth God has revealed.
  - **Respond**: Offering our heart's movement, be it adoration, praise, or a simple 'yes' to conversion. The Spirit guides this.
  - **Request**: Asking for the grace needed to live out what we have received and responded to.
  - **Rejoice**: Giving thanks for God's goodness, His Word, and the very gift of this time with Him, even if it feels dry.
- **Contemplation (_Contemplatio_)**: This is often the quiet culmination, a simple resting in God's presence. It is less about _doing_ and more about _receiving_ His truth and grace, savouring His nearness. Think of it not as striving, but as simply being present, allowing God to work within. It is His gift, and feeling nothing does not mean nothing is happening.

Consider, as a pattern for this prayer, that pivotal moment: the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The angel speaks (Reading), Mary ponders the greeting (Meditation), she asks her question and receives the astonishing answer â€“ "nothing is impossible with God" (Prayer - Receive/Respond), and finally, she offers her magnificent 'Fiat': "Let it be to me according to your word" (Prayer - Respond/Request/Rejoice).

Mary's 'yes' is our model. Troubled, questioning, yet ultimately trusting in God's power and plan, she said yes to a Person, not merely a proposition. This practice invites us to imitate her total response, placing our trust and finding our peace in God, even when the path is mysterious. It is a way to receive the good news, praise God for His salvation, ask for the Spirit's help to believe, and rejoice in His boundless grace, following the example of that first, perfect disciple. Through such prayer, we are drawn into the Divine Life itself, learning fidelity and trust.
