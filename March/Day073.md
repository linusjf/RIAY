### AI-Generated Summary: The Boy in the Temple and the Nature of Seeking

Consider the peculiar incident of the Boy Jesus, at the tender age of twelve, being lost and found in the Temple. It is a passage rich with meaning, far beyond a simple domestic drama.

- His parents, Mary and Joseph, endured three days of anxious searching, a poignant picture of human worry even within the Holy Family. Their relief at finding Him among the learned teachers is palpable.
- Yet, Jesus' response to His mother's gentle rebuke is startling: "Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" This is His earliest recorded utterance, a profound declaration of His divine sonship and purpose, spoken with the quiet authority of one already about His essential business.
- Mary, we are told, kept these things in her heart, a reminder that even those closest to God do not always immediately grasp the full mystery.
- This episode prompts a question for us: How do _we_ seek Him? Jesus' question, "How is it that you sought me?", echoes through the ages, inviting us to examine the manner and place of our own seeking.
- Do we seek Him in the clamour and distractions of the world, or in the quiet precincts of His "Father's house"—in prayer, in His Word (Scripture), in the Sacraments, in the stillness? The text gently suggests the latter is the true path.
- Seeking God is not merely our effort; it is a dance of love wherein He also seeks us, desiring our company in the silence and stillness where His voice is heard.
- The struggle is real, for worldly pursuits often seem easier or more immediately gratifying than the discipline of seeking God in the quiet. Yet, the call remains: to surrender our own plans, remove distractions, and seek Him wholeheartedly.
- Ultimately, the reflection leads to prayer—a request for renewed desire, freedom from hindrances, and the grace to seek Him as He wills, trusting in His goodness and presence found in the Word, in prayer, and in the Blessed Sacrament. The journey of seeking is met by the reality of being sought.
