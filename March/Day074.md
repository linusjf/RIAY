### AI-Generated Summary: The First Light Baptism and Belonging

Herein lies a brief account of a reflection upon the Rosary, that venerable pathway, focusing upon the first of the Luminous Mysteries.

- This practice serves as a means to deepen our relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Mother, receiving thereby a measure of grace.
- The session employed _Lectio Divina_, a sacred reading, centred upon the Baptism of Christ as recorded in Matthew 3:13-17, under the theme "begin as the Beloved."
- The scripture recounts the profound moment: Jesus submitting to John's baptism, the heavens opening, the Holy Spirit descending visibly like a dove, and the very voice of the Father declaring, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
- This mystery reveals Christ as the promised Messiah, offers a glimpse of the Holy Trinity, and marks the commencement of Jesus' public work by unveiling His true divine nature.
- The heart of the reflection rests upon the great truth that Jesus is the Beloved Son, and through our relationship with God, we are invited to share in this same glorious status. Our fundamental identity is that of beloved children of God.
- This truth is presented as the unshakable bedrock for all faith, hope, confidence, and trust in God. Though our actions may at times displease Him, unlike Christ's perfect obedience, His love for us as His children is constant.
- To live a life pleasing to God is not a means to earn His love, but rather flows naturally from receiving and trusting in the reality of being already beloved.
- Building one's life upon this foundation—the secure knowledge of being loved by the Father—provides the necessary strength and perseverance to navigate the trials and difficulties encountered, much as Christ Himself endured.
- The prayer arising from this reflection is one of thanksgiving for this divine revelation and a plea for the grace to truly trust in this identity, to remain firmly rooted in it, and to live from this place of secure belonging, relying upon the Holy Spirit's strength.
- The session concludes with thanksgiving for the gifts of revelation, baptism, prayer, and received grace, with an encouragement for continued silent communion with the Lord.
