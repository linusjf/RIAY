### AI-Generated Summary: The King Has Come

Here is a brief consideration of that luminous mystery concerning the Proclamation of the Kingdom. The core of the matter, drawn from the Gospel of Mark, is astonishingly simple yet utterly profound: Jesus of Nazareth declared that the time long foretold was now fulfilled, and the very Kingdom of God was at hand.

What does this mean, this "Kingdom"? It is not merely a place, but God's active, present reign – His healing, saving, teaching, and shepherding work amongst us. And Jesus Himself stands revealed as the King, the awaited Messiah, establishing this reign, indeed, presenting Himself as the Bridegroom come to unite souls to His own life.

The invitation extended is therefore urgent and twofold:

- **Repent:** Not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental change of mind and heart, a turning away from our own small, crooked paths.
- **Believe:** To trust utterly in this Good News, that the Kingdom is truly here, the Shepherd truly present, desiring to guide us.

The text rightly stresses the immediacy of this call. The time for hesitation is past; the time to surrender our entire lives, trusting Him completely, is _now_. We are urged to release whatever hinders this full surrender, allowing Jesus, our true Shepherd, to lead, protect, and guide us into peace.

This Good News – that the King, the Shepherd, the Healer is present and active – is the heart of the matter. The response called for is an open heart, a willing repentance, and a complete giving of oneself. Such a response is often nurtured and expressed through prayer, seeking the grace to remain open, surrendered, and trusting, allowing the Good Shepherd to do His work within us. The conclusion of such prayer is naturally filled with rejoicing and gratitude for the grace received and the peace found under His gentle, powerful hand.
