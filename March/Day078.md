### AI-Generated Summary: His Body Given For You

Here is a brief contemplation on a profound mystery, aimed at deepening our walk and becoming vessels of grace.

- We fix our gaze upon the Fifth Luminous Mystery: that Supper where Our Lord, on the very eve of His suffering, gathered with His own.
- Consider the scene: Jesus, knowing full well what lay ahead, yet filled with an intense, burning desire to share this final Passover. It was not merely duty, but a profound yearning to complete the Father's will and offer Himself for the world's salvation. He saw Himself already as both the Priest and the Lamb.
- Then came the astonishing act. He took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, declaring, "This is my body given for you." He took the chalice, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you."
- Mark well those simple, yet earth-shattering words: "given for you," "poured out for you." The very heart of the matter lies in that personal, direct address â€“ _for you_. He did not merely perform a ritual; He gave Himself, utterly and entirely, for _each_ soul present and for every soul to come.
- This is not just a memory we recall, but a reality in which He remains present. He is the Bread of Life who gives Himself and continues to give Himself in the Holy Sacrament, driven by that same earnest desire for total self-gift and for the reception of _you_.
- The good news, the very core of His heart revealed at that table, is this: He burns with love for you and freely gives His life, His body, His blood.
- Our response? To receive this incredible gift of being beloved, of being given for, and in turn, to offer back our poor selves entirely in response to His magnificent, total self-giving. We are called to live within the covenant sealed by His blood.
- This leads us naturally to adoration, gratitude, and a longing for deeper reverence and more frequent communion with Him, praying for the grace to respond with our own total gift of self. For He is truly "God with us," present in His passion and His Eucharistic heart. This time of prayer, often including familiar petitions like the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary, is our humble attempt to receive and respond to this boundless love.
