### AI-Generated Summary: The Thorn-Crown, the Prodigal, and Our True Name

Prayer, particularly through the contemplation offered by the Rosary, serves as a potent means to deepen our fellowship with Christ and His Mother, Mary. It is a wellspring of grace, guiding us into the heart of divine mysteries.

Let us consider the third Sorrowful Mystery, the Crowning with Thorns. Here we witness the Son of God subjected to cruel mockery, stripped of His garments, draped in a scarlet robe of scorn, crowned with piercing thorns, and struck by those who would deny His kingship. This scene, recorded in Matthew's Gospel, is not merely historical; it speaks to a profound spiritual reality.

This suffering illuminates the plight of the soul ensnared by sin. Think of the Prodigal Son, who, having squandered his inheritance, came to himself in the pigsty. He resolved to return, seeing himself as utterly unworthy of sonship, fit only to be a hired servant. Sin, you see, is a cunning deceiver. It first lures with false promises of freedom or pleasure, then turns upon its victim, accusing, condemning, and finally mocking, seeking to redefine the soul by its failures. It whispers, "You are not a beloved child, but merely a sinner, a slave to your lowest actions."

This is the Enemy's masterstroke: to convince us that our identity is forged in the fires of our sin, rather than in the eternal love of the Father who created and redeemed us. We begin to judge ourselves by our worst moments, feeling like a 'sinner' rather than a 'son' or 'daughter'.

Yet, behold Christ in His agony! Even beneath the thorns, amidst the jeers and blows, His identity remained utterly steadfast. He knew, with an absolute certainty, that sin was an external assault, not His inner truth. He was, and is, the Beloved Son, the King, regardless of the mockery.

We are called to learn from Him. When our past choices or the Enemy's whispers challenge our sense of worth and dignity, we must remember that sin does not define us. Our true name is 'beloved child of God'. The Father sees us not through the lens of our failures, but with eyes of unconditional love. He will deliver, restore, and welcome us home, just as He welcomed the Prodigal, not as a servant, but with a feast for His son. The call is ever to return, trusting in His boundless love and restorative power, despite all that seeks to hold us captive.

Through prayer, framed by the Sign of the Cross and the hallowed words of Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be, we root ourselves in this truth, seeking protection from the lies that attack our identity and clinging to our reality as God's beloved children in Christ Jesus.
