### AI-Generated Summary: Hope and Courage from the Risen Lord

To draw nearer to Christ and His Mother, we find a sure path through prayer and quiet reflection, a source from which grace flows like a hidden stream. Our thoughts turn now to that stupendous event, the first of the Glorious Mysteries: the Resurrection, as told in Matthew's twenty-eighth chapter.

Consider the scene: the breaking dawn, the tremor of the earth, the angel like lightning – clear signs of a divine intrusion into our ordinary world. The first, quite natural, response of the women was fear. And indeed, the guards were struck senseless by it all.

Yet, the core message from the angel, and later from the Risen Lord Himself, was this: "Do not be afraid."

- This command is not a mere suggestion, but the very consequence of Christ's victory over death. The angel declared, "He is not here, for he has risen as he said."
- The empty tomb and the ability to touch His feet were simple, undeniable proofs that this was no ghost, but the Crucified One, now alive.
- Because He has conquered death, the ultimate terror, we are given leave to face life's lesser terrors – its trials, its injustices, its uncertainties – without being mastered by them.
- Trusting God does not promise an easy passage, but it guarantees that suffering and evil do not have the final, crushing word. Life in Christ, and God's ultimate triumph, does.
- The Resurrection is the wellspring of a hope that does not disappoint, a solid reality upon which we can stand.

How then might we engage with this glorious truth in prayer? A simple pattern might serve:

- **Receive:** Take into your very being the good news that Jesus is Risen, victorious, trusting utterly in the Father. Accept that death and suffering are overcome, and life in Christ prevails.
- **Respond:** Offer adoration and praise to the Risen Lord, the Author of Life, the Conqueror of Death, the true Light of the world. Praise the Father for His steadfast faithfulness. Welcome the grace of hope into your heart and internalize that liberating command: "Do not be afraid." Bring your own struggles with fear, trust, or perseverance before Him.
- **Request:** Ask for the grace to fully embrace this resurrection hope. Pray that you might often return to the image of the empty tomb, the enduring sign that the Crucified One lives and that death and injustice are vanquished.

In this vital commerce with the Risen Lord, we seek and receive the hope, confidence, and peace we so desperately need. Bring your anxieties and concerns; trust that He speaks into them the same powerful, fear-banishing word: "Do not be afraid." Give thanks for this time, for the quiet, and for the Gospel which unveils this profound mystery. Remain in His presence, receiving the peace that flows from His victory.
