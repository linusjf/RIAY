### AI-Generated Summary: The Perpetual Blessing of the Ascended Lord

- Consider, if you will, the practice of the Rosary and prayer, which serves as a most helpful path towards a deeper intimacy with our Lord Jesus and His Blessed Mother, and proves a rich source of divine grace.
- Let us fix our minds particularly upon the Second Glorious Mystery: the Ascension. As recounted in the Gospel of Luke, we see Jesus blessing His disciples just before He is taken up into heaven. But mark this well: His departure was not an abandonment, but a transition to a new, profound mode of presence.
- From His ascended state, Jesus is now present and active in our lives without the limitations of earthly locality. He is always seeing, always hearing, always ministering, caring, and protecting. The very image of His ascent, hands raised in blessing, assures us that His benediction upon His followers is continuous, eternal, and unending.
- The disciples, far from being saddened by His physical departure, understood this shift to a presence accessed by faith. They worshipped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, their hearts filled with perpetual praise for God. This highlights a beautiful, continuous exchange: Jesus' never-ceasing blessing upon believers met by their never-ceasing blessing and praise of God.
- The Father's faithfulness, so evident in Christ's obedient earthly life and His victory over death, is crowned in the Ascension. Seated now at the Father's right hand, Jesus reigns eternally, having secured for us a new and more immediate access to Himself than was possible even before. He is constantly blessing us, ministering to us, pursuing us, and pouring out grace.
- Our fitting response to this glorious reality is one of wholehearted praise, adoration, worship, and rejoicing in His ascension and the access it has granted us. We give thanks for His loving gaze and the blessing He continually bestows.
- We are called to return this blessing by remaining in a continuous spiritual relationship with Him, keeping our gaze fixed upon Him, and journeying through life alongside Him. We seek the grace to receive the joy of the ascension fully and to persevere in this vital connection, living always under the warmth of His loving gaze.
- The essence of this prayerful reflection is to turn our spiritual sight upon Jesus as He looks upon us, to receive His blessing, and to respond in kind through adoration and speaking with Him, fostering a perpetual, mutual exchange of divine love and human praise.
