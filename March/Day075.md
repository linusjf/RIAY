### AI-Generated Summary: The Best Wine Last

Consider the simple, profound matter of prayer and meditation, how it draws one closer to the Lord Jesus and His Mother, Mary, and becomes a channel of His favour. Our thoughts turn to that curious tale from Cana, told in the Gospel of John.

- At a wedding feast, a common predicament: the wine ran out. Jesus’ mother, ever watchful, brought this lack to His attention.

- He then gave a surprising command to the servants: fill six great stone jars with water. And there, by His power, He turned plain water into wine – and not just any wine, but the very best.

- The steward, unaware of the miracle, remarked that the host had saved the finest till the end. This was Jesus' first 'sign', showing forth His glory and kindling belief in His followers.

- One might see in this Jesus as the true Bridegroom, providing the new wine, which is the Spirit Himself, a gift of sweetness, strength, hope, and charity. After this, He journeyed to Capernaum with His family and disciples.

- This first public wonder at a wedding marks the beginning of His great work, leading towards Calvary. And mark this well, Mary’s very last words recorded in the Book are to the servants, and to us: "Do precisely what He bids you."

- The miracle also whispers a great truth: with Jesus, the best is kept till the end.

- Consider Mary’s part in this. She noticed the lack of wine and laid the matter before Jesus. This shows us that they are not distant, but keenly aware, seeing our needs and concerns. They know us.

- This applies to our own souls. Mary sees those dry stretches where the wine seems quite run out – where we lack strength, perhaps, or struggle with belief, or the very question of who we are, or the persistent gnawing of temptation. She brings these needs to Him, knowing He cares and can act.

- The great comfort is this: we are not left to ourselves in our struggles. Jesus and Mary see us, care deeply, and are already responding. He is the Bridegroom who gives His very life for His Bride.

- Indeed, the soul was made for the Bridegroom. He provides the new wine, the Spirit Himself. He sees, He cares, He knows your very name and your need, especially when you feel quite empty, or the old comforts have failed you.

- What is our part then? Adoration, surely, and praise for Him, the Bridegroom who sacrifices for His Bride. And gratitude for Mary, who understands and stands near.

- We must ask for the grace to do as He bids, following Mary’s simple, clear command. Ask for the new wine, the Spirit's strength, to press on in hope and confidence, trusting that the best is, indeed, yet to come. Perhaps our very emptiness is the space made ready for Him to fill anew.

- Give thanks for His love, that He is the Bridegroom, and for the quiet, powerful work of the Spirit. Let us open ourselves fully to receive this Spirit, finding hope in the simple, profound truth that we are seen and known by Him, and by His Mother.

- This journey often involves the familiar paths of prayer: The Pater Noster, the Ave Maria repeated, the Gloria Patri. Begun and ended with the sign of the Cross.

- As our time of shared prayer draws to a close, if the Spirit has stirred you, continue on this path. Gratitude for this time together, looking forward to walking further together. And finally, a blessing upon you.
