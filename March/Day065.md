### AI-Generated Summary: The King's Return and Our New Access

Now, the Ascension: a mystery indeed, glorious and perhaps, at first glance, a touch perplexing. We see the Man, Jesus, blessing His friends, then lifted up, vanishing into the cloud, returning, as it were, to His own country. It might seem, to the disciples left behind, like a parting, a loss. Yet, consider the homecoming of a great King, having won the decisive battle, returning to His capital city. Is that a loss for the city? No, it is triumph! Heaven itself, we are told, sang with joy at the Victorious King's return to the Father's house.

But what of us, still here? Does His going mean distance? Not at all. This is the heart of the matter, a paradox only God could weave. As Pope Benedict reminds us, when He said, "I go away and I will come to you," He meant a _new_ coming, a perpetual presence made possible by His being with the Father.

Think of it like this:

- His ascent is not abandonment, but a transition to a different mode of being with us.
- Just as from the mountaintop He saw His disciples struggling on the sea and came to them, so from the Father's right hand, unrestricted by earthly bounds, He sees us always.
- His presence at the Father's side means He is _more_ accessible, not less, for He is now everywhere that God is.
- Indeed, His going was necessary and good, for it paved the way for the coming of the Holy Spirit.
- The Spirit is the very means by which we gain this ongoing, privileged access and closeness to the ascended Christ.
- Through the Spirit, we can call upon Him, certain that the King on His throne sees and hears us.

So let us not view the Ascension as a farewell, but as the enthronement of our King, enabling a deeper, more constant fellowship with Him through the power of the Spirit. It is a cause for great joy and confident prayer, knowing He reigns and is ever near.
