    "image_prompt": "A serene, stylized illustration in the manner of Studio Ghibli, showing a quiet, meditative scene where soft light filters through a tranquil space. In the foreground, a person sits in peaceful contemplation, hands resting gently on their lap with five distinct fingers each, face calm and features anatomically correct. The background subtly blends two mystical elements: on one side, a young boy converses with wise teachers in an ancient temple, representing joyful discovery; on the other, a luminous river under an open sky with a dove descending, symbolizing divine affirmation. The composition is spatially coherent with balanced perspective, evoking a sense of harmony and reflective silence, influenced by Loish's soft yet detailed character artistry."
