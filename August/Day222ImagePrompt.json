  "image_prompt": "A layered abstract composition evoking the rhythm of repeated prayer. Floating geometric forms—semicircular arches and soft rectangular planes—suggest worn steps or weathered pages. Dominated by deep indigo and gold, with translucent veils of ochre and ivory overlapping like whispered devotions. Kandinsky-esque floating lines trace the motion of rising petitions, while Rothko-inspired color fields hum with quiet reverence. No figurative elements, only the impression of enduring spiritual resonance through time."
