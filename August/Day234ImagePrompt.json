{"caption":"A Year‑Long Rosary Journey in Sorrowful Grace","image_prompt":"Abstract composition evoking a year‑long rosary journey: interlocking circles symbolise beads, layered vertical bands of deep crimson and muted gold suggest the sorrowful mysteries and the light of grace, while luminous blue swirls weave through the canvas to represent the Holy Spirit. A rising, translucent halo of light—textured with thick impasto reminiscent of Rothko’s color fields—dominates the centre, flanked by Kandinsky‑inspired geometric fragments—triangles, arcs, and fragmented lines—that hint at the mysteries without depicting them literally. The sorrowful mysteries unfold as a descending gradient from crimson to indigo, while the upper portion glows with golden light, expressing growth in faith, forgiveness, and gratitude. The overall composition is dynamic, with overlapping shapes and expressive textures that prioritize emotion and interpretation over realism, avoiding any depiction of hands or feet."}
