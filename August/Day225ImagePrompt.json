  "caption": "A symphony of sorrow in abstract hues, where thorns and crosses dissolve into color and form",
  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the weight of thorns and the burden of the cross through layered geometric forms and expressive textures. Dominated by deep crimson and gold intersecting with jagged black shapes, suggesting both agony and transcendence. The lower half features a heavy, shadowed mass resembling a bent figure or burden, while the upper portion radiates with fractured lightâ€”blues and whites breaking through like divine presence amidst suffering. No literal figures, hands, or feet are depicted; only the emotional resonance of sacrifice through color fields and dynamic tension."
