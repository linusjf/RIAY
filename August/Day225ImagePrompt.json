  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by the tension of Caravaggio's *The Crowning with Thorns*, rendered in the styles of Kandinsky and Rothko. Dominated by sharp, intersecting angular shapes suggesting thorns, layered over a softly glowing central form that evokes a bowed head. The palette contrasts deep, shadowy blues and blacks with luminous golds and whites, using expressive textures to convey both weight and ethereal light. No literal figures or limbsâ€”only symbolic forms that evoke humiliation, grace, and the interplay of divine radiance against darkness."
