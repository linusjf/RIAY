  "image_prompt": "A vibrant abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, featuring radiant geometric forms in luminous gold and white evoking the Transfiguration's glow, interwoven with deep crimson and warm ochre shapes suggesting the Eucharist's sacred mystery. Floating concentric circles and soft-edged rectangles create a sense of heavenly revelation, while layered translucent washes of color suggest both mountaintop radiance and sacramental depth. The lower portion contains earthy brown and red organic forms balancing the celestial upper section, with subtle textural variations evoking both fabric and bread. The overall palette moves from cool celestial blues and whites to warm eucharistic reds and golds, united by a glowing central axis of divine presence."
