  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition evoking maternal divinity through layered fields of luminous color. Soft, radiant golds and celestial blues merge in geometric harmony, suggesting a protective presence without literal form. Floating organic shapes—reminiscent of veils and halos—drift amid translucent overlays, while subtle textures echo fabric and starlight. The lower third deepens into rich crimson and earthy tones, symbolizing uplifted humanity. Kandinsky-inspired concentric circles pulse with quiet energy near the center, implying connection between realms. Rothko-esque color transitions suggest infinite compassion through gradients of violet and pearl."
