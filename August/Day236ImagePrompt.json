    "caption": "The crucifixion and resurrection form the foundational pillars of redemption, revealing both the cost and victory of divine love.",
    "image_prompt": "A powerful and reverent triptych-style illustration. The left panel depicts the crucifixion on a rough-hewn wooden cross, showing a detailed, anatomically correct human form with a sorrowful Mother Mary below, her heart pierced symbolically. The right panel shows the empty tomb with a large circular stone rolled away, the interior glowing with light. The central panel features the resurrected Christ, a solid and tangible figure with glorious, visible wounds on His hands and side, offering them to a doubting Thomas. The art style is influenced by the profound and emotive works of sacred Renaissance art, with dramatic lighting and deep, rich colors."
