    "caption": "The ultimate sacrifice and glorious resurrection offer both profound sorrow and everlasting hope.",
    "image_prompt": "A diptych-style image. Left panel: A crucified figure, a kingly yet suffering man, on a wooden cross under a stormy sky, His face radiating divine forgiveness despite agony; a grieving mother below, her expression bearing the weight of incomprehensible love and sorrow; a desperate thief looks on nearby. Right panel: A brilliantly lit, empty stone tomb with a broken seal; a radiant angel delivers joyous news; the same figure, now gloriously resurrected and emanating light, shows the marks of His sacrifice on His hands to a doubting man, His expression full of compassion and victory. Art style is epic, high-concept biblical artwork with dramatic lighting, immense emotional depth, and anatomically precise figures, influenced by the compositional gravity of Renaissance masters and the luminous hope of Baroque painting."
