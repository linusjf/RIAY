  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the Nativity and Presentation through layered geometric forms. A central radiant gold circle suggests the divine presence, surrounded by soft blues and deep purples in floating rectangular fields. Angular, intersecting lines hint at a manger structure, while warm ochres and earthy tones ground the scene. Translucent veils of color suggest reverence and mystery, with subtle textures evoking aged parchment and star-like specks. The palette balances celestial luminosity with earthly humility, avoiding literal figures but conveying sacred encounter through form and hue."
