  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition in the styles of Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the quiet companionship of Mary. Floating geometric forms in soft blues and radiant golds intertwine like whispered prayers, suggesting presence without literal depiction. A central warm glow emerges from layered translucent shapes, symbolizing sheltering love. Jagged crimson fragments near the edges hint at the Cross's shadow, while fluid white strokes radiate outward like a quiet 'yes'. The textures range from velvety to ethereal, with no discernible figuresâ€”only the emotional resonance of divine nearness in ordinary moments."
