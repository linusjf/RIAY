{"caption":"Pilgrims journey toward the sunrise, bearing the cross with humble faith.","image_prompt":"A stylized, dreamy illustration of a pilgrim priest in a flowing robe, holding a rosary, standing on a winding mountain path toward a distant sunrise. He carries a wooden cross, its crown of thorns visible, and a gentle companion, Simon, a young boy with a small wooden cross, walking beside him. The background shows a misty valley with distant hills, a faint silhouette of a church bell tower. The scene is rendered in soft pastel colors, with subtle light rays breaking through clouds, reminiscent of Studio Ghibli and Loish's warm, organic style. The perspective is slightly low-angle, giving the pilgrim a heroic yet humble posture, with anatomically correct hands holding the rosary and cross, each hand with five fingers. The overall composition evokes reverence, journey, and spiritual guidance."}
