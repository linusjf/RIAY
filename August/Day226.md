### AI-Generated Summary: The Holy Spirit's Gentle Mastery

To bring one’s intentions before the Holy Spirit is much like Mary’s surrender at the Annunciation, when she was overshadowed by divine power yet remained perfectly herself. In that holy paradox, we see how the Spirit neither crushes nor bypasses our will, but elevates it—turning fear into courage, wounds into healing, and stubborn hearts into vessels of grace. Forgiveness and conversion are not our achievements, but His gifts; not labored for, but received. The same wind that filled the Virgin’s humble _fiat_ now whispers to every soul that dares to say, _Be it done unto me_.
