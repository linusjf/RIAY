### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Child Among the Teachers

We are shown two sacred scenes, dear reader, each a window into the mystery of the Incarnation. The first, _The Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple_, presents the boy of twelve seated among the learned men, His young face alight with wisdom beyond His years, while His mother and foster-father search for Him with tender anxiety. Here is no mere youth, but the very Son of God, revealing Himself even then as the fulfillment of the Law.

The second, _The Baptism of Christ_, unfolds at the River Jordan, where John, the last of the prophets, pours water over the One who needs no cleansing. The heavens are rent asunder, the Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father’s voice thunders—not for His sake, but for ours—declaring, “This is my beloved Son.” In these moments, eternity breaks through time, and we glimpse, as through a glass darkly, the truth that has been from the beginning.

As for the prayers that follow—repetitions of the _Hail Mary_ and _Glory Be_—they are like footsteps worn smooth by generations of pilgrims, each one a small act of love, a turning of the heart toward the Light.
