### AI-Generated Summary: The Weight of Thorns and Light

Caravaggio’s _The Crowning with Thorns_ is no mere spectacle of cruelty, but a window into the divine drama of humiliation and grace. Here, in the dim chamber of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Christ’s bowed head accepts the mocking crown, each thorn a echo of our own rebellions pressed upon the sinless. The painter’s hand, wielding chiaroscuro like a sword, cleaves light from shadow—as if to say that even in this darkness, Heaven’s radiance cannot be extinguished.

The text invites us not to glance, but to kneel before such scenes: to carry our own storms and sorrows, as Christ carried His cross, into the quiet furnace of prayer. Two intentions per decade—no more, no less—lest we mistake devotion for distraction. For in the _Hail Mary_ and the _Our Father_, as in Caravaggio’s brushstrokes, eternity bleeds into time, and the soul, like the Savior in that flickering gloom, is both wounded and illuminated.
