### AI-Generated Summary: The Soul's Homage to the Triune God

To adore the Holy Trinity is to be drawn into the very life of Love Himself—a mystery so vast that the heart trembles, yet so near that the humblest soul may enter. St. Elizabeth of the Trinity, with the clarity of a saint, teaches us to pray not as distant suppliants, but as children who have found their home in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Her words, tender yet bold, echo the _Catechism_’s call to lose ourselves in that divine fellowship where praise becomes our breath and surrender our joy.

The prayers repeated here—Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be—are not mere recitations, but the well-worn steps by which ordinary mortals ascend to heaven. In them, we learn that devotion is not grandiloquence, but faithfulness; not novelty, but the patient turning of the heart toward the Light. Let it be so for us all.
