### AI-Generated Summary: On the Passion and the Rising Again

We are presented with two pictures of a single, world-altering fact. The first is a picture of the Thing done: the ultimate sacrifice offered upon the wood, where the King of all worlds, in the very act of His execution, pleads forgiveness for His tormentors and grants a thief’s desperate plea for remembrance. There we see, also, His mother, whose heart is pierced not with any mere sorrow, but with the awful, glorious weight of a love she could scarcely comprehend.

The second picture is not of the Thing done, but of the Thing undone. It is the empty tomb, the broken seal, and the Angel’s news which turns all grief to joy. Here He stands, the same and yet gloriously changed, bearing the marks of His suffering not as scars of defeat but as the very tokens of His victory. He offers them to a doubting friend, not in rebuke, but as the final evidence that what seems impossible to Man is the common work of God. This is the wellspring of our hope—the sure knowledge that from the deepest darkness, He can and shall bring forth an everlasting light.
