  "image_prompt": "A composition of layered, translucent geometric shapes in deep blues and radiant golds, evoking the interplay of divine light and human supplication. Angular forms suggest uplifted hands (without depicting fingers), while overlapping circles imply interconnected prayers. A central gradient of crimson to white symbolizes the heart's altar, surrounded by fragmented yet harmonious patterns that recall stained glass. The lower third grounds the piece in earthy ochres, anchoring the ethereal upper layersâ€”Kandinsky's dynamism meets Rothko's contemplative fields."
