    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed digital painting in the style of Renaissance masters like Raphael and Juan de Juanes, depicting a sacred, luminous scene. In the foreground, a person kneels in prayer with an open Bible, their face turned upward in awe. Above them, a divine light emanates from an open book, illuminating the room. In the background, subtle visual echoes of the Transfiguration—a figure in a mandorla of light on a mountain—and the Last Supper—a long table with a central figure holding a host—are blended seamlessly into the atmosphere. The lighting is dramatic and celestial, with deep shadows and golden highlights, creating a sense of profound reverence and divine connection.",
