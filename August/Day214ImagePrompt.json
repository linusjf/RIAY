A pair of weathered hands clasped in prayer, their stillness contrasting with the faint motion of the candle's flame. The background is sparseâ€”no ornate decorations, just the quiet weight of devotion. The atmosphere is serene, timeless, as if each whispered word lingers in the air like invisible brushstrokes on an eternal canvas."
