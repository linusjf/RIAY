### AI-Generated Summary: The Ever-Fresh Mystery

The well-worn path of a repeated prayer is not a prison for the spirit, but a door; and it is we who must choose to turn the handle and step through. The wise man does not merely tread the same stones day after day, but pauses to notice a new aspect of the vista—the light through a different branch, the scent of the air after rain. So it is proposed that one should approach these holy mysteries not as a task to be completed, but as a country to be explored. By fixing the mind upon a fresh particular in a well-known scene—a single joy in the Annunciation, a singular grace in the Visitation—the whole is made new again. This is the work of a lifetime: to let the familiar become a well of endless depth, that by this varied contemplation, the soul might continually draw nearer to the Divine Life which is its source.
