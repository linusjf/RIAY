  "image_prompt": "Create an abstract composition that fuses the luminous mystery of the Transfiguration with the sacred banquet of the Eucharist, in the combined visual language of Vassily Kandinsky and Mark Rothko. Use broad vertical fields of deep indigo and violet at the base, fading upward into a luminous band of golden yellow and soft white that suggests a heavenly light. Across the golden band, place geometric, radiant shapes—sharp triangles and angular rays—evoking a mountain summit bathed in divine glow. Insert overlapping, semi‑transparent circles and elongated ellipses in muted earth tones to symbolize the prophetic witnesses, their forms interlocking without literal figures. Below the light, introduce a simplified, abstract chalice formed by a thin vertical rectangle intersecting a wider horizontal band, rendered in rich crimson and deep burgundy, with a split rectangular shape nearby to hint at broken bread. The textures should range from thick, impasto brushstrokes in the upper luminous fields to smooth, blended gradients in the lower tones, emphasizing emotional resonance over realism. Avoid any depiction of hands, feet, or digits."
