### AI-Generated Summary: On Hearing the Divine Voice

We often suppose that God is silent in our prayers, a complaint as common as it is sorrowful. But the true trouble, I suspect, lies not in a failure of His speech but in a failure of our own hearing. We listen for a command, for a voice from a whirlwind, and miss the Word which speaks continually through the sacred page. For the scriptures are the sure ground upon which we may meet Him; by reading and praying with the Bible, we allow His thoughts to become our own, and our private prayers are then informed by that which is eternally true.

This leads us quite naturally to the great mysteries which make tangible that truth. Consider the Fourth Luminous Mystery, the Transfiguration, captured in Raphael's masterwork. There, upon the mount, the Lord is suspended in a mandorla of divine light, flanked by the lawgiver and the prophet, while below, the apostles shield their eyes from a glory they can scarcely comprehend.

Then follows the Fifth Mystery, the Institution of the Eucharist, portrayed by Juan de Juanes with solemn devotion. The God-Man stands at the centre of the long table, the consecrated host held aloft, while around Him the faces of the apostles reveal the first awe of that everlasting sacrifice. In these mysteries, we see the story of our faith made manifest, a perpetual reminder of the glory that was revealed and the gift that was given.
