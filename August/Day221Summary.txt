### AI-Generated Summary: The Discipline of Devotion and the Weight of Mystery  

Consider two moments where Heaven stooped low to touch our dusty world: first, when the boy Christ lingered in the Temple, astonishing the learned with His wisdom; second, when the grown Man stood in Jordan’s waters, hallowing all rivers with His humility. These are not mere events to recite, but mysteries to enter—like a man stepping through a door into a vast country.  

Prayer, dear reader, is no trifle to be rushed. As a muscle grows by steady strain, so the soul strengthens by patient meditation. Begin with twenty Hail Marys, as one begins a journey with a single step. Ponder the angel’s greeting—*"Hail, full of grace"*—not as empty words, but as a thunderclap that shook the universe. For in that moment, eternity kissed time, and a maiden’s *yes* undid Eve’s *no*.  

The prayers themselves are but ropes to bind our wandering minds to the mast of truth. Repeat them until the words wear grooves in the heart, and through them, grace may flow unhindered.
