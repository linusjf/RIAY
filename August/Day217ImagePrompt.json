  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition of interwoven golden spirals and translucent veils, evoking the mystery of the Holy Trinity. Layers of soft, radiant light in hues of ivory, sapphire, and crimson flow like liquid grace, suggesting the Father, Son, and Spirit without literal forms. Delicate fractal patterns emerge like whispered prayers, dissolving into a luminous void at the centerâ€”a visual echo of the soul's surrender. The texture resembles aged parchment inscribed with faint, glowing script, while the overall atmosphere balances awe with intimate warmth."
