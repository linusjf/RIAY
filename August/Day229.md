### AI-Generated Summary: The Blessed Exchange of Joy

The angel’s annunciation to Mary—that most wondrous interruption—ushers in not merely a message, but the Maker of messages Himself. Her swift “let it be” is the hinge upon which all human history turns. Then see how she carries this uncontainable joy to Elizabeth, whose unborn child leaps in recognition. Here is the first echo of the Gospel: the high meeting the low, the divine hidden in the ordinary. Ponder these mysteries well, for in them lies the pattern of all true joy—a gift given, a gift received, and a gift passed on.
