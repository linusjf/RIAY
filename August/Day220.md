### AI-Generated Summary: The Silent Song of the Nativity

What we have here, dear reader, is not a painting but a prayer—a repeated refrain, like the steady rhythm of a heartbeat or the turning of the seasons. The Nativity, that third joyful mystery, is invoked not through brushstrokes or carved stone, but through the quiet cadence of _Hail Marys_ and _Glory Bes_. It is as if the very absence of artistic detail speaks louder than any depiction might; for sometimes the deepest truths are best approached not by sight, but by the soul’s own recollection.

Think of it as a window left open—not to show us a scene, but to let the wind of devotion stir within us. The artist’s hand is unseen, the medium unrecorded, yet the subject remains: that humble, radiant moment when Heaven touched Earth. And so we are reminded that some mysteries need no adornment; their power lies in the telling, and the hearing, and the heart that holds them.
