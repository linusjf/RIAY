### AI-Generated Summary: On the Recollection of Prayer

We find, as so often happens, that the state of our common life is the very state of our prayers. A life filled with the noise of the world will, of necessity, produce a prayer likewise filled with that noise. The path to a quieter, more meditative practice is not found in some new technique, but in the old and simple way of reducing the din of our daily affairs and learning to live more peaceably. For it is only from a peaceful life that a peaceful prayer can grow.

This reflection is framed by two great mysteries. The first is the joyful finding of the Boy Jesus in the Temple, conversing with the teachers—a moment of both loss and discovery that speaks to the heart of seeking. The second is the luminous baptism in the Jordan, where the heavens were opened and the ministry began—a moment of divine affirmation and purpose.

And so we conclude with the ancient prayers, asking for forgiveness and mercy, for salvation and peace, not for ourselves alone, but for all souls. A parting blessing, then, for your companionship in these thoughts.
