### AI-Generated Summary: On Spiritual Dryness

It is a truth of the interior life, known to every soul who has attempted a serious commerce with the Divine, that the well of feeling will often run dry. One comes to prayer and finds it a desert, a duty, a recitation of words that seem to fall like stones to the ground. This, my dear reader, is not a sign of failure but a crucial part of the journey—a call to make an offering not of sweet emotions, but of the will itself. It is a pure act, a gift of time given not for what one receives, but simply because He is worthy of it.

Yet this very dryness may also be an invitation, a gentle nudge from Our Lady to turn the coin over and see its other face. Perhaps one is to approach the familiar mysteries from a new quarter—to gaze not merely on the event, but upon the Persons present: the Trinity, or the quiet, radiant figure of the Blessed Virgin herself. One might take up a new book of meditations, or better still, a painting that shows the mystery in a fresh light, for art is often a key to a door long thought locked.

And what are the mysteries set before us? The second Luminous Mystery shows us the wedding at Cana, where the water of ordinary duty was turned, at His Mother’s request, into the wine of joy. The third is the Proclamation of the Kingdom, that great and terrible summons to repent and believe, which is the very core of the Master’s work. In persevering through our own dryness, we participate in both: we bring our plain water of effort, and we answer that royal summons with the obedience of faith, trusting that the joy will come in its own good time.
