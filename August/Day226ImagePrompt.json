  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by the Holy Spirit's gentle mastery, blending Kandinsky's dynamic forms with Rothko's emotive color fields. Layers of translucent blues and golds suggest divine presence, while soft, overlapping shapes evoke movement and surrender. A central luminous form, reminiscent of a dove's wing, hovers amidst swirling currents of color, symbolizing the Spirit's whisper. The background transitions from deep violets to warm whites, echoing the transformation of fear into courage. Textures are soft yet vibrant, with no literal figuresâ€”only the interplay of light and form to convey sacred paradox."
