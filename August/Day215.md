### AI-Generated Summary: The Weight of Glory in Art and Prayer

Consider two masterpieces, each a window into the Sorrowful Mysteries. First, Caravaggio’s _The Crowning with Thorns_—a brutal yet luminous scene where light and shadow wrestle upon the canvas, much as cruelty and grace contend in the human soul. Here, Christ’s suffering is no distant tale but a present agony, rendered with such vividness that one might flinch to meet His gaze.

Then El Greco’s _Christ Carrying the Cross_, where the Savior’s form stretches heavenward, as if the very wood He bears seeks to pull Him earthward while His spirit strains upward. The colors burn with unearthly fire, a reminder that pain, too, may be transfigured.

Yet these are not mere relics of piety to be admired and shelved. The true meditation begins when we step into the frame—when the thorns press against _our_ brows, when the cross’s weight bows _our_ shoulders. For prayer is no recitation of old words, but the daring act of walking beside Him now, in the ordinary moments where He still whispers, "Follow."
