### AI-Generated Summary: The Maternal Love of Mary in Prayer  

Imagine, if you will, a mother’s tenderness—not merely human, but divine—extended to every soul in need. Such is the invitation of meditative prayer when one lifts others to the care of the Blessed Virgin. Picture her as Titian did in *The Assumption of the Virgin*, radiant amid the heavens, or as Fra Angelico portrayed in *The Coronation of the Virgin*, crowned with humility beside her Son. These visions are not idle fancies but windows into a love that stoops to mend our brokenness.  

To pray thus is to place each troubled heart into hands that have cradled the Infant Christ. See her, in your mind’s eye, bending over the sick, the lonely, the despairing, as once she bent over the manger. For love, when truly imagined, becomes a bridge between heaven and earth—and what better guide across it than she who bore Love Incarnate?
