  "caption": "A soul's quiet prayer in abstract devotion",
  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the humility and stillness of prayer. Soft, layered fields of deep blues and warm golds suggest a sacred space, with floating geometric forms—perhaps a subtle cross or circular motifs—symbolizing divine presence. Gentle gradients and textured brushstrokes create a sense of quiet movement, as if light is emerging from within. The arrangement is meditative, avoiding literal figures but conveying reverence through shape and color."
