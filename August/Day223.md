### AI-Generated Summary: The Light of the Mount and the Bread of Life

Consider two mysteries, dear reader, where Heaven stooped low to touch the earth: first, upon the mount where His face shone like the sun, and His garments became white as light; second, in the upper room where common bread was made His very flesh. These are not mere events, but windows into eternityâ€”the Transfiguration, a glimpse of glory awaiting all who love Him, and the Eucharist, the daily miracle by which He feeds us with Himself.

Prayer, like a ladder, lifts us toward these mysteries, and Mary, our Mother, stands ever ready to guide us upward. Yet how often we forget that these are not distant wonders, but present realities! The mount and the supper-room are nearer to us than we dare believe, if only we have eyes to see. Let us then approach with awe, and with hearts open to the light that never fades.
