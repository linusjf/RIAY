  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the intersection of divine and earthly realms. Dominated by a dynamic interplay of luminous gold and deep blue, suggesting the meeting of heaven and earth. Angular, geometric forms in the upper half symbolize divine wisdom, while fluid, organic shapes below represent the waters of Jordan. A central, radiant burst of white suggests the moment of grace, surrounded by layered textures that evoke both the weight of mystery and the lightness of revelation. No figurative elements, only expressive color fields and symbolic forms that convey transcendence and devotion."
