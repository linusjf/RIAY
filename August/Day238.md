### AI-Generated Summary: The Queen's Crown and the Christian Hope

We are shown a picture of the end for which we were made, not in some abstract doctrine, but in the person of a woman assumed into glory. She is, you see, the firstfruits of the harvest, the promise that what is sown a natural body will be raised a spiritual body. Her song, which begins with a blessing for herself, ends with a prophecy for all the poor and hungry of the earth; the private joy becomes the public hope.

And from this assumption flows her coronation. If the first is the promise, the second is the pattern. She is crowned not for her own sake, but to be our Mother and Advocate, to intercede with a love that understands our weakness. Her whole purpose is to draw us toward that same Spirit, to grant us the grace to say our own ‘yes’ and to trust, as she did, in the Father’s perfect faithfulness. It is a picture of the world made right: where the humble are exalted and love reigns from a throne.
