    "image_prompt": "A split composition illustrating two divine mysteries. On the left, Christ ascends in glory, His human form radiant and transcendent, ascending through clouds towards a heavenly realm where divine light emanates. His posture is victorious and gracious, arms outstretched in blessing, embodying a new mode of being present to all creation. On the right, an upper room where the Virgin Mary and the disciples wait in prayerful unity. Tongues of fire descend upon them, not as destructive flames but as gentle, renewing light. In the foreground, a transformed Saint Peter, filled with the Spirit, stands boldly preaching to a multitude, his face alight with conviction and grace, his hands—each with five distinct fingers—raised in proclamation. The art style is inspired by the luminous and anatomically faithful concept art of Studio Ghibli, with rich details, coherent perspective, and a palette of celestial blues and fiery golds."
