  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, depicting the divine invitation at Cana and the dawn of the Kingdom. Use layered, translucent washes of deep blues and radiant golds to evoke the transformation of water into wine. Geometric shapes suggest a wedding feast—floating circles for vessels, soft arcs for tables—while bold, overlapping rectangles in crimson and white symbolize the new dispensation. Avoid literal figures; instead, let jagged, upward strokes in luminous yellow represent divine presence breaking into the earthly realm. Textures mimic both the roughness of clay jars and the smoothness of wine, with a central gradient where cool blues dissolve into warm reds. The overall effect is one of quiet revelation bursting into celebration."
