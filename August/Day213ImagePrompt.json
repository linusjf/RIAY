  "caption": "A barren landscape of hollow words, where prayer and art remain unseen, like a bird too afraid to fly.",
  "image_prompt": "A desolate, monochrome landscape with scattered fragments of broken, hollow words lying like dry husks on cracked earth. A lone bird, wings half-spread but never taking flight, hovers near the ground. In the distance, a faint, unreachable glow suggests a feast of beauty and devotion, untouched. The scene evokes emptiness, repetition, and the absence of true spiritual or artistic vision."
