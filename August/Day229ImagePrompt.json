  "caption": "Divine interruption woven in sacred geometry, where celestial whispers birth the uncontainable",
  "image_prompt": "A dynamic abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the Annunciation through intersecting planes of luminous gold and deep violet. Angular, translucent forms suggest a celestial messenger dissolving into geometric radiance, while a central organic shape—softened by layered blues—symbolizes the 'let it be' moment. Below, warm crimson and earthy ochre fields ripple with concentric circles, echoing the leaping recognition. The palette balances transcendent brilliance with earthly tones, textures ranging from ethereal glazes to thick impasto strokes, conveying the collision of divine and human. No literal figures, hands, or feet are depicted."
