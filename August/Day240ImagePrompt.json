    "image_prompt": "A stylized digital illustration in the soft, contemplative style of Studio Ghibli, showing a person in quiet prayer within a serene, sun-dappled garden. Their mind is visualized as a small, flitting bird that occasionally wanders from their head, but is always gently guided back by a calm, ethereal hand. The scene is warm and peaceful, with a path of well-worn prayer beads leading towards a distant, glowing home, symbolizing grace and return."
