### AI-Generated Summary: The Poverty of Unseeing Prayer  

What we find here is not the rich tapestry of devotion but a barren repetition, like a child reciting words without grasping their meaning. The soul, when it prays, ought to ascend—yet these empty phrases circle the same ground, like a bird fluttering near the earth but never taking wing.
