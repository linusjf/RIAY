  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition of layered symbolism: a radiant, fragmented heart suspended in a storm of gold and crimson brushstrokes, evoking both wound and glory. Below, a ghostly dove dissolves into textured wisps of smoke and light, its form merging with jagged, flame-like tendrils that rise like prayers. The background shifts from deep indigo to translucent white, suggesting a veil between realms. No literal figures, only the interplay of sharp angles and soft gradients, where pain and tenderness collide in a dance of luminous contrast."
