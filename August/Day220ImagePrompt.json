  "caption": "A silent hymn of color and form, where the Nativity sings without figures",
  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking the Nativity through layered fields of radiant gold and deep blue. Geometric shapes suggest a stable's architecture—soft rectangles for walls, a floating triangle for a roof. A central luminous form, neither star nor child but pulsing with warmth, glows amid overlapping translucent veils of color. Textures mimic whispered prayers—subtle brushstrokes like murmured words, thin washes like candlelight. The palette balances reverence and mystery: midnight blues, earthy ochres, and sudden flares of celestial white. No literal figures, only the impression of awe through shape and hue."
