  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition inspired by Kandinsky and Rothko, evoking divine revelation through layered geometric forms. A radiant central shape—gold and translucent white—symbolizes the Child among teachers, surrounded by jagged, angular forms in deep blues and purples representing wisdom and tension. Below, fluid washes of blue-green suggest the River Jordan, with a descending dove-like form in soft whites and grays. The upper half fractures into luminous yellows and oranges, as if heaven's voice tears the canvas. Textures vary from smooth gradients to rough, expressive brushwork, avoiding literal figures but conveying awe and sacred encounter."
