    "image_prompt": "A richly detailed illustration in the style of sacred iconography and Studio Ghibli's spiritual elegance, depicting a woman assumed into glory, crowned as a queen upon a heavenly throne. She has a compassionate, anatomically correct face with serene expression and hands gently extended in intercession, five distinct fingers visible. She is surrounded by a luminous aura, with symbols of firstfruits and harvest at her feet. The composition conveys deep humility and exaltation, with a celestial backdrop suggesting a world made right, where the poor and hungry are blessed, and divine love radiates from her throne in warm, golden light."
