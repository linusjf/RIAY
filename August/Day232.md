### AI-Generated Summary: The Divine Invitation at Cana and the Kingdom's Dawn

Here we see two glimpses of the same great story—the Maker stepping into His own creation, first quietly at a wedding, then openly before the world. At Cana, His mother, with that tender watchfulness which marks all her actions, notices the small earthly embarrassment of the hosts. She brings it to Him, and He, though His hour was not yet come, answers her unspoken request. The water turned to wine is more than a kindness to a bridal pair; it is the first sign of the new dispensation, where mere nature is transfigured by grace.

Then He steps forth, proclaiming the Kingdom not as a place or a theory, but as Himself—His presence, His words, His very flesh. The call to conversion is no stern demand but an invitation: come, be remade, enter into joy. Miracles follow not as proofs to silence doubters, but as the natural overflow of God walking among men.

In these mysteries, we find the pattern of all divine work: the hidden made manifest, the human touched by the eternal, and the persistent whisper—"Turn to Me, and live."
