### AI-Generated Summary: The Weight of Thorns and the Burden of the Cross  

Consider two paintings—one by Caravaggio, the other by Titian—each a window into the sorrow of Christ. In *The Crowning with Thorns*, Caravaggio wields shadow and light like a blade, carving anguish into the canvas. The soldiers’ cruelty is palpable, their mockery as sharp as the thorns they press upon His brow. Here is suffering made visible, not softened by time but raw, immediate.  

Titian’s *Christ Carrying the Cross* offers a different sorrow: the slow, grinding weight of obedience. The cross bends His shoulders; the crowd swirls about Him, indifferent or hostile. Yet in the richness of Titian’s colors, one glimpses the paradox—that such burden-bearing is itself a kind of kingship.  

These are not mere scenes to admire, but mirrors to peer into. What do we see there? Perhaps our own refusals to bear lesser thorns, our reluctance to lift lighter crosses. And if we look long enough, we might also find the quiet invitation: to follow, even when the road is steep and the crown is sharp.
