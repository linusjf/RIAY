  "image_prompt": "An abstract composition evoking spiritual ascent through layered, luminous forms. Dominated by a vertical gradient of deep blues ascending into radiant golds and whites, suggesting the heavens opening. Floating geometric shapes—semi-transparent circles and soft-edged triangles—symbolize divine presence and the descent of grace. Below, a cluster of warm, glowing reds and oranges in fluid, overlapping forms represents the fiery Spirit and the gathered faithful. The texture is soft yet dynamic, with blurred edges conveying movement and transcendence. No literal figures, only the interplay of color and form to express yearning and divine encounter."
