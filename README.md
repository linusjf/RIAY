##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro _when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope._
_What we believe in should change us_
_Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God_
_Our body and soul should connect when we pray_
\_Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us*🥹
\_We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.*
\_We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thank you Lord for this relationship you give us through prayer🙏

##### AI-Generated Summary: A Year-Long Journey to Deeper Prayer Through the Rosary

This summary provides an overview of a year-long program designed to deepen prayer through the Rosary. The program emphasizes understanding the theological underpinnings of the Rosary and cultivating a deeper relationship with the Trinity and the Blessed Mother.

**Main Topics:**

- **Structured Prayer Program:** The program is divided into six phases, guiding participants through a progressive journey of prayer.
- **Theological Foundation:** It emphasizes understanding the biblical roots of the prayers and their application to daily life.
- **Engaging with Scripture and Tradition:** The program incorporates _lectio divina_, writings of the Saints, and sacred art to enrich prayer.
- **Practicing the Presence of God:** This is a core element, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging God's presence before, during, and after prayer.
- **Gradual Progression with the Rosary:** Participants gradually increase the number of decades they pray, culminating in praying the full Rosary.
- **Developing a Relationship with Jesus and Mary:** The program encourages a personal connection with Jesus and Mary, fostering love and devotion.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Prayer as Dialogue:** Prayer is not a monologue but a dialogue with God, requiring us to acknowledge and receive His presence.
- **Importance of Preparation:** Before engaging in formal prayer, it's crucial to create space and prepare our hearts and minds to receive God's presence. This can involve practices like deep breathing, visualizing sacred spaces, or reflecting on scripture.
- **Raising the Mind and Heart to God:** This involves offering our whole selves to God – our joys, sorrows, hopes, and fears – and receiving His love and grace in return.
- **The Rosary as a Journey:** Learning to pray the Rosary is a process that requires patience and practice. Over time, it becomes a source of grace and power.
- **Practical Application:** The program provides concrete techniques and examples to help individuals cultivate a deeper prayer life, such as using the Sign of the Cross, incorporating sacred art, and reflecting on specific scriptural passages.

**Notable Insights and Quotes:**

While the provided text doesn't contain direct quotes, several insightful concepts emerge:

- **"Waiting for God to connect":** The analogy of waiting for someone to answer the phone before speaking emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's presence before launching into prayer. This highlights the shift from monologue to dialogue.
- **"Receiving God's presence":** The text emphasizes that God is always present; we need to actively receive His presence. This underscores the importance of intentionality and receptivity in prayer.
- **"Prayer as a movement of the will":** While prayer can evoke emotions, it's fundamentally an act of the will, a conscious decision to turn towards God.
- **"Learning to pray is like learning to dance":** This analogy captures the initial awkwardness and the eventual grace and rhythm that develop with practice.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Six Phases:**

1. **Forming the Relationship:** Focuses on the foundational elements of prayer, learning to raise the mind and heart to God.

1. **The Biblical Roots:** Explores the scriptural basis of the prayers, deepening understanding and connecting them to daily life.

1. **Meditating on the Mysteries:** Introduces _lectio divina_ and engages with the writings of the Saints and sacred art as aids to prayer.

1. **Finding Focus:** Applies the learned principles, building the capacity to pray with the mysteries of the Rosary, starting with one decade at a time.

1. **Building Up the Decades:** Gradually increases the number of decades prayed, leading towards praying the full Rosary.

1. **Praying the Full Rosary:** The culmination of the program, focusing on receiving the graces of the full Rosary.

**Concluding Ritual:** The daily practice concludes with a structured sequence: the Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, three Hail Marys, the Glory Be, and another Sign of the Cross. This provides a consistent framework for ending the prayer time. The emphasis on expressing love to Jesus and Mary reinforces the relational aspect of prayer.

##### The King Knows You

[![The King Knows You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lW9LA2uYhp0 "The King Knows You")

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 02 Michelle Jackson

_The King knows "you/me"_
_This is so personal for me_
_The king of the universe knows me even before i was knit in my mother's womb,\* \_He knows the very number of hairs on my head,_ _how precious and heart striking it is to know that._ _The King sees me, the King Knows me, the King "Loves" to hear my voice_ ❤‍🔥 _and the King knows my name_ 🥰🥰
_My God My God how I love Thee. This way of praying having the image of Him in our hearts when we pray is something so precious, we see ourselves and feel so unworthy while all along He looks at us in Love._
_Thank you Jesus._
_i once asked Jesus while at a retreat to call to my name aloud and He did while it was on the last day of the retreat we were all having a JAM dance (Jesus and me) in the midst of all the music and loud noise I heard someone call my name it was clear and soft I asked my husband if he called my name and he said no and I knew it at once it was Jesus who called my name. So yes ,The King knows me/ the King knows you/ the King knows each of us by name_ 😇🥹❤‍🔥

##### Day 2 - Michael Eltham

A good pairing to today’s episode “The King knows you” would be to read and ponder on Psalm 139.

LORD, you have probed me, you know me: you know when I sit and stand;
you understand my thoughts from afar.

You sift through my travels and my rest;
with all my ways you are familiar.

Even before a word is on my tongue,
LORD, you know it all.

Behind and before you encircle me
and rest your hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
far too lofty for me to reach.

Where can I go from your spirit?
From your presence, where can I flee?

If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
if I lie down in Sheol, there you are.
If I take the wings of dawn
and dwell beyond the sea,

Even there your hand guides me,
your right hand holds me fast.

If I say, “Surely darkness shall hide me,
and night shall be my light”

Darkness is not dark for you,
and night shines as the day.
Darkness and light are but one.d

You formed my inmost being;
you knit me in my mother’s womb.

I praise you, because I am wonderfully made;
wonderful are your works!

My very self you know.
My bones are not hidden from you,

When I was being made in secret,
fashioned in the depths of the earth.

Your eyes saw me unformed;
in your book all are written down;
my days were shaped, before one came to be.

It is good to simply be held by our Father, to rest in His bosom. Knowing that He is always watching over us and we are precious to Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### AI-Generated Summary: Encountering the King in Prayer

This section explores the profound experience of encountering Jesus in prayer, particularly through the lens of the Litany of the Sacred Heart. The speaker initially expresses a past aversion to litanies due to a lack of comprehension regarding the titles attributed to Jesus. However, recent study and contemplation have unveiled the depth and poetic beauty within these titles, leading to a newfound appreciation. A litany, as defined in the segment, is a vocal prayer with a specific focus, incorporating invocations that highlight the titles and attributes of the divine mystery being addressed.

The core of this reflection centers on the invocation "Heart of Jesus, King and Center of All Hearts." The speaker encourages listeners to visualize Christ the King upon his throne, surrounded by angelic hosts, radiating majesty, and holding the world in his hand. He is depicted as omnipotent, the ultimate lawgiver, ruler, and victor. Crucially, and perhaps most importantly, this King knows each individual by name.

To illustrate this point, the speaker recounts a personal anecdote about collaborating with Father Mike Schmitz on video projects for an extended period, despite being geographically separated and having limited direct interaction. The speaker was deeply moved when Father Mike addressed them by name, demonstrating a personal connection despite the lack of close contact. This anecdote serves as a powerful analogy, highlighting that even though Father Mike is a recognizable figure in Catholic media, he is not the literal King of the Universe, unlike Jesus.

This leads to the central theme: Jesus, the Eternal King, possesses an intimate knowledge of each person. He knows our names, formed us in the womb, and even knows the number of hairs on our heads. The speaker emphasizes the importance of envisioning oneself in the King's throne room during prayer, recognizing that He yearns for our presence and focuses intently on us. However, we often allow distractions to our attention – worries, anxieties, our phones, or the lives of others. This is compared to the biblical account of Martha, who busied herself with many things, while Mary chose the better part by sitting at Jesus' feet.

The speaker urges listeners to emulate Mary and choose the better part. This involves approaching the King on his throne, engaging in direct eye contact, and making him the center of our attention. It necessitates recognizing that He sees and knows us completely. We are encouraged to hear Him speak our name, to be attuned to the stirrings within our hearts, and to respond authentically. Sharing our love, needs, and desires with Him is vital because Jesus cherishes the sound of our voices. The message is clear: speak to Him. Maintain Him as the focal point of our hearts, attention, and lives as we pray the Our Father, three Hail Marys, and the Glory Be. The key takeaway is the constant reassurance that the King sees us, knows us, loves to hear our voice, and knows our name.

The segment then transitions into the recitation of the prayers mentioned: the concluding portion of the Lord's Prayer ("Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen"), followed by three Hail Marys and the Glory Be. The inclusion of these prayers within the segment reinforces the message of actively engaging with Jesus in prayer. The session concludes with a brief expression of gratitude and a farewell.

Notable insights from this segment include the reframing of litanies as poetic expressions of devotion, the powerful analogy of Father Mike Schmitz recognizing the speaker by name, and the emphasis on Jesus' intimate knowledge of each individual. The central message is a call to prioritize our relationship with Jesus, making Him the center of our hearts and lives, and engaging in authentic communication with Him through prayer. The visualization of being present in the King's throne room serves as a powerful tool for fostering this connection and deepening our understanding of His love and attention. The concluding prayers offer a practical application of this message, encouraging listeners to put these principles into practice.

##### RIAY Day 3 Heart of Jesus Michael Eltham

Working in corporate America often feels like being caught in a relentless race—striving to be the best, fastest, most accurate, and efficient. The pressure to complete tasks quickly and be the first to market can overshadow the joy and love for the work itself. However, today’s episode of Jesus in St. Joseph’s Workshop was a profound reminder: Jesus has been with me all along, accompanying me in every moment of my work life.

He sees me in my failures, encourages me when I feel like giving up, rejoices in my successes, and prays for me in moments of complacency.

Let us invite Jesus and St. Joseph into our daily work. With their presence, the labor of our hands will be blessed, and even the most mundane tasks will regain their purpose and meaning.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### RIAY Day 3 - Marcy

So grateful for the RIAY.
Being in the workshop with Jesus as my teacher today was just awesome 👌. I was not anxious, nervous or afraid but was excited that now I am really going to get it right. I am not in a hurry, I will be patient, I will do my best to listen and follow the instructions, even when a heavy tool falls on my toe or if I miss the target and bash my fingers 😉, I will dance to the pain till it cools off and will continue trying till I get it right. 🙏

##### Rosary IN A YEAR DAY 03- Heart of Jesus Michelle Jackson

_Jesus who are You?_
_Jesus, What is Your heart like?_
_Jesus, what is Your heart like to me?_
\_Jesus is my safe space, my home, my heaven, my best friend, my hope, my life, my saviour, my EVERYTHING. The very meaning of my life_❤‍🔥
Yes Jesus' heart is full of Patience and Mercy
I see myself like a child in His workshop and inspite of Him giving me instructions i keep interrupting Him and asking if i'm doing well and all i see is He smiles back at me , im in a hurry but He is not, He's full of Love and I feel so safe and free to be myself that even though i'm messing up He's not angry or upset. Im trying to keep up, looking at what He's doing but i don't seem to match n i cry , and just then He tells me His secret, that He loves spending time with me and loves it that i'm spending time with Him. And that's what Mamma told Him, that we need to spend time together.😭❤‍🔥🥹 It melts my heart hearing that, i drop the tools and jump onto Him and He embraces me.
This picture within is so real the truth to it all - Jesus and i in His workshop,was not for what i came for but that i came to be with Him and He values that so much.
Jesus values the time we give to Him even though we may not know now or feel it strongly, but we will know it once we enter into that personal relationship with Him ,which He waits for eagerly. Shalom.🙏🏽🏼

##### RIAY Day 3 - Gavril

"Mom wants us to spend time together more than she wants these new candlesticks. In fact, just us spending time together is the greatest gift we can give to her"
This was the most beautiful line in the meditation🥹

##### AI-Generated Summary: Finding Peace and Presence in Prayer

Father Mark Mary's reflection centers on experiencing prayer as a personal encounter with Jesus, emphasizing his patient and merciful nature. He guides a meditative visualization of working alongside Jesus in Joseph's workshop, crafting candlesticks for Mary. This exercise encourages listeners to reflect on their emotional response to Jesus's presence, contrasting the stress of striving for perfection with the peace and freedom found in his acceptance.

Key takeaways include:

- **Prayer as Encounter:** Prayer is not about perfect execution but about connecting with the living God, Jesus, who knows and loves each individual.
- **Jesus's Patience and Mercy:** Jesus is depicted as a patient and merciful teacher, understanding of our mistakes and valuing our time with him above all else. His gaze is always patient and merciful.
- **Embracing Imperfection:** It's okay to be imperfect in prayer. Distractions, mistakes, and even falling asleep are acceptable. What matters is praying with love and trust, like a beginner learning from a patient teacher.
- **Focusing on Presence:** Imagining Jesus's presence during prayer, especially the rosary, can deepen the experience and foster awareness of his love and understanding.

Notable insights include the analogy of learning in a woodshop with Jesus, highlighting his willingness to restart projects and provide new materials, emphasizing the importance of the relationship over the task. The speaker also addresses those uncomfortable with closeness to Jesus, encouraging honesty about their feelings. Finally, the emphasis on Mary valuing time spent with Jesus above all else underscores the relational aspect of prayer. The reflection concludes with a guided prayer incorporating the Hail Mary and Glory Be, reinforcing the practical application of these principles.

##### RIAY Day 4/ 04- 01- 2025

_Praying with Mary_
Immaculate Heart of Mary beside the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a picture frame has been in my heart and home for like forever. Yet it took me a minute to focus on a picture of Mother Mary to pray.
Very beautifully reflected upon by Fr... Mary was actively involved in the growth of her Son Jesus in every aspect Mind Body and Spirit, her own beloved Son..and then John her second beloved son...then San Juan " Am I not your mother?" And the list can go on...

God our loving Father I pray today for myself and all Catholics who have taken Our Blessed Mother Mary for granted and for all who have turned their back on her. _may we understand that we cannot and never will be able to love her more than Jesus did_
May we receive grace everyday through her maternal intercession. Amen.
Poco poco Fr Mark. God bless you too. Thankyou. 🙏🏻

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 04 - PRAYER WITH MARY - Michelle Jackson

The depth of Mamma Mary mirroring the Light of Christ, and the reflection of our God in her, the way Father Mark put that sounded simple but was deep, it calls us to understand that slowly by slowly layer by layer, she mothered what was asked of her she took it all in and did what was asked of her she even went beyond when she took st John to be her son now, what a responsible son Jesus is handing over His beloved Mother to His disciple not wanting her to be alone, and he becomes her son and She his Mother. i believe that they are here with me at home. Greeting Mamma and Jesus when we leave home and return feels like we're never alone. It's a deep relationship, with our Mother who never leaves our side. In the words of Mother Teresa, she asks when we feel low or lonely ask Mamma to be a Mother to me now and knowing she always has and will be, is such a gift from God our Father and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. 🙏🏽Mamma Mary bring all the lost to Jesus. Let those who have never experienced a mother's love feel yours strongly. Amen Shalom

##### Biblical Roots of the Rosary

[![Biblical Roots of the Rosary - Intro to Phase 2 of the Rosary in a Year Podcast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/biblicalroots.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8Vv86L0uhco "Biblical Roots of the Rosary - Intro to Phase 2 of the Rosary in a Year Podcast")

##### AI-Generated Summary: Returning Home Through Scripture and Tradition

Jeff Cavins shares a powerful testimony of spiritual transformation rooted in Scripture and tradition. Raised in a nominal Catholic environment, his spiritual journey led him to Protestant ministry before rediscovering the Catholic faith through deep engagement with Scripture and Church history. His development of the Bible Timeline chart became a pivotal tool for exploring the overarching narrative of the Bible and reconnecting with Catholic traditions, especially Marian devotion.

###### Key Takeaways

- **Conversion Through Scripture**: Jeff’s rediscovery of the Catholic faith was grounded in his hunger for understanding the “big story” of the Bible. His initial detachment from Marian beliefs stemmed from poor formation, but his study of the early Church and biblical typology led him to embrace them fully.

- **Mary as Queen Mother**: A key turning point was understanding the biblical foundation of Mary’s role. In ancient Near Eastern kingdoms, the queen mother held a position of honor and intercession—fulfilled by Mary in the Kingdom of God. Jesus entrusting Mary to John on the cross is interpreted as a universal gift of spiritual motherhood to all believers.

- **Repetition in Prayer**: Concerns about "vain repetition" in prayers like the Rosary are addressed by distinguishing between empty, performative repetition and meaningful, meditative prayer. Drawing from Church tradition and Scripture, repetition is shown as a rhythm of life—like a heartbeat—central to devotion, not opposed by Jesus.

- **The Rosary as Scriptural and Meditative**: The Rosary draws heavily from the Bible, especially the Hail Mary, which combines the angel Gabriel’s greeting and Elizabeth’s blessing from Luke’s Gospel. It’s a means of walking through the life of Christ with Mary as a guide and intercessor.

- **Spiritual and Practical Application**: The Rosary is praised for its portability and tactile nature—it can be prayed anywhere and serves as a “temple in time.” It’s a prayer that grows in richness with deeper scriptural knowledge, especially when meditating on the mysteries of Christ’s life.

- **Integration of Life and Prayer**: The rhythm of the Rosary mirrors the seasons of human life—joyful, luminous, sorrowful, and glorious. These stages align with family, suffering, and spiritual growth, offering a profound way to journey with God.

###### Memorable Quotes

- _"I had such a hunger for Scripture... but I didn’t know the story."_

- _"When I studied the early Church, I realized everything I was doing couldn’t be found there—but everything they were doing could."_

- _"God is not against repetition—our heartbeat, our breathing, even wisdom in Hebrew is learned by repetition."_

- _"Mary, the Queen Mother, doesn't take away from Jesus. She magnifies Him, as she leads us through His life."_

- _"The Rosary allows us to create a small temple in time—a place of peace and focus wherever we are."_

This testimony highlights how Scripture and Catholic tradition can work together to bring clarity, depth, and renewed faith, especially through the rediscovery of Mary’s biblical role and the power of contemplative prayer.

##### Our Father in Heaven

[![Our Father in Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/Day008.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WOaecrQZS5s "Our Father in Heaven")

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 08 - "OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN" Michelle Jackson

\*God is Good, all the time, and all the Time, God is Good!! How God Loves us is so precious, and that truth needs to take root in us, i love that when Jesus' disciples asked Him how to pray He said; say "OUR FATHER!!" that relationship He extends to us is unfathomable. He wants us to know That He is our Father and Jesus came to reveal that to us, to restore that relationship that was broken in the beginning. He wants us to approach Our Father as little children who don't need to use big words or our language to be perfect but simply, us being like Children who are learning to talk. But with great reverence and adoration. God understands our hearts more than we ever know or the words we want to speak even before we say it. Thank you Yeshua for teaching us to pray and Thank you Abba Father for allowing us to call You "OUR FATHER".\*🙏🏽

##### AI-Generated Summary: Approaching God as Father

This episode initiates the "Biblical Roots of the Rosary" series, focusing on the Our Father. Specifically, it examines "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name" through the lens of Genesis 32:13, where Jacob attempts to appease his brother Esau with lavish gifts out of fear. This narrative serves as a counterpoint to the prayer's message.

The key takeaway is that prayer should not be driven by fear or a desire to appease God like Jacob did with Esau. Instead, we should approach God with the reverence due a loving father and the confidence of a beloved child. The speaker uses the analogy of his relationship with his own father, highlighting the difference between formal respect and the easy familiarity of a son. This emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's power while simultaneously approaching Him with simple humility and trust.

The episode encourages listeners to reflect on their own prayer life, asking: Do you approach God as a loving father or as someone to be feared and appeased? It prompts introspection and a desire to purify one's approach to prayer.

The episode includes the recitation of the Our Father, three Hail Marys, and the Glory Be, reinforcing the practical application of the discussed principles. The core message is a call to cultivate a childlike trust and intimacy with God in prayer.

##### Thy Will Be Done

[![Thy Will Be Done](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/Day009.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gnkxlNFBGcs "Thy Will Be Done")

ROSARY IN A YEAR Day 09 - "THY WILL BE DONE" Michelle Jackson

Mathew 18 :1-4 , Jesus talking about who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? It is the children who will be the greatest in His Kingdom. God is calling each of us to be like little children, like children who aren't afraid to ask their parents for anything, they are themselves and they don't need to work on themselves to get things done, they simply approach them in confidence and Joy. Here Jesus calls us to be like them, surrendering themselves to the Father with Child like confidence and Trust. That He will always do what's best for us. We need to be humble like Jesus and do as He did in the garden by saying Thy will be done not mine. In all moments of life when life is challenging and we are uncertain we need to approach God and give way for His Will to be done. Then we will have true peace and Joy and experience the Kingdom of heaven.🙏

##### AI-Generated Summary: Childlike Dependence and Experiencing God's Kingdom

This reflection explores how to live out the prayer "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven" by embracing the childlike nature Jesus highlighted in Matthew 18.

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **The Nature of Children:** Children are presented as inherently "poor" – dependent, lacking knowledge and resources, and vulnerable. Crucially, in a healthy environment, they accept this dependence without shame or frustration, naturally turning to parents for all needs. Despite their neediness, they often exhibit joy and levity.
1. **Childlike Humility as the Key:** This trusting dependence and acceptance of one's limitations ("poverty") is the essential characteristic for entering and experiencing the Kingdom of Heaven.
1. **Experiencing the Kingdom Now:** The Kingdom isn't just a future reality. It is experienced _now_ when we acknowledge our dependence, limitations, and needs, and bring them directly to God the Father without shame, self-hatred, or resorting to anxious self-reliance. This act of trusting dependence meeting God's providence _is_ the Kingdom experience on earth.
1. **Contrast with Adult Tendencies:** Adults often react to their inherent limitations with shame, frustration, and a drive for self-reliance, which hinders experiencing the peace of the Kingdom.
1. **Trusting God's Will:** Praying "Thy will be done" mirrors the childlike trust that the Father knows best, loves us, and will provide what is truly needed, even if we don't know what that is (illustrated by the child-in-restaurant analogy). Jesus models this perfectly in Gethsemane.

**Key Takeaways:**

- True Christian humility involves recognizing and accepting our dependence on God without shame.
- Bringing our acknowledged poverty and need to God in trust is how we experience His Kingdom and its peace _now_.
- We are called to shed the adult burdens of shame and self-reliance regarding our limitations.
- Trusting God's will ("Thy will be done") frees us from anxiety and allows us to live with joy and confidence, like a child secure in their parent's care.

**Notable Insights/Quotes:**

- The core insight: Bringing our dependence to meet God's perfect Providence _is_ the experience of the Kingdom now, and its fruit is peace.
- Children accept dependence "without shame, discouragement, or self-hatred" and are "not tempted towards self-reliance."
- The goal is "childlike trust and dependence, without shame or frustration."
- Jesus' prayer, "Father... not my will but your will be done," exemplifies the trusting relationship we enter through the Our Father.
- The alternative to self-burdening is the "freedom, confidence, joy, and peace that comes from giving our burdens to God... saying, 'Father, thy will be done in all things.'

##### Daily Bread

[![Daily Bread](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/Day010.jpg)](https://youtu.be/5j0Q_eP-ec0 "Daily Bread")

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 10 - " DAILY BREAD" Michelle Jackson

Give us this day our daily bread. Jesus wants us to trust Him and asks us not to be anxious about the next day. He tells us we are of more value than the birds of the air and that as He provides for them who neither sow nor reap nor gather them into the barns yet He provides for them. Our God is Jehovah Jireh - "The God who provides" God Himself is our portion. Jesus came so that we may have life in abundance and He wants us to trust Him. We need to persevere in Joy and Faith and go to Him daily in prayer and communion. This bread is the sharing of His own divine life. This grace we receive flows generously from Him but we need to come to Him and receive that daily. Like the Israelites who had to collect their daily bread we too christians have to do the same through prayer. We get to receive Him in the Sacraments the Holy Eucharist which is real bread, Himself! to live the Life He's offering to us. Thank you Jesus for this life giving food you give to us all.

##### AI-Generated Summary: Daily Bread Daily Grace

This theological reflection centers on the petition "Give us this day our daily bread," focusing intently on the word "daily."

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **The Manna Narrative (Exodus 16):**

This Old Testament story serves as a foundational illustration. God provided manna to the Israelites in the desert, instructing them to gather only enough for one day. This demonstrated God's reliable, day-by-day provision and taught dependence on Him, showing that everyone received exactly what they needed for that specific day. This event prefigures Jesus.

1. **Jesus' Teaching on Anxiety (Matthew 6):**

The reflection connects the manna story to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, specifically His command not to be anxious about future needs (like food or drink), pointing to God's care for creation (e.g., birds). 3. **Grace as Spiritual "Daily Bread":**

For Christians, the "daily bread" is interpreted primarily as internal, spiritual nourishment – God's grace. This grace, encompassing faith, hope, and charity, is a share in God's divine life. 4. **The Role of Daily Prayer:**

Accessing this daily grace requires active participation. Personal prayer each day is presented as the means by which individuals approach God to receive the necessary spiritual sustenance.

**Key Takeaways:**

**\*Focus on the Present:**

The core message is to trust God for _today's_ needs and challenges, rather than worrying about the future. God provides what is necessary _for this day._

**Sufficiency of Grace:** God's grace is abundant and sufficient for the present moment's demands – enabling perseverance, carrying one's cross, and living generously and joyfully \*today\*. It's not necessarily stockpiled for future use.

**Active Reception:** Like the Israelites gathering manna daily, Christians must actively seek and receive God's grace each day through personal prayer.

**Jesus as Provision:** Ultimately, Jesus Himself is our "daily bread," the source of the grace needed for the spiritual journey. Trust is placed in God Himself, who is always present.

**Notable Insights:**
The manna story insight: "those who gathered a lot had no excess, and those who gathered little had no lack" highlights the precise sufficiency of God's daily provision.\_ The shift from external manna to internal grace marks the fulfillment found in Christ.

Anxiety about the future is countered by understanding that God provides specifically for \*today\*, requiring a daily return to Him. In essence, the message encourages a life lived in daily dependence on God, accessed through prayer, trusting that He provides the necessary spiritual strength (grace) to navigate each day's challenges and live faithfully in the present moment.

[![As We Forgive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/refs/heads/main/January/jpgs/Day011.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hSa8NhXUgws "As We Forgive")

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 11 - "AS WE FORGIVE" Michelle Jackson

"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us". That truly isn't something we can do by ourselves. We need Grace. God is calling us to share in His Divinity through the Grace we receive through the HolySpirit in Jesus. We are called to do as He does and that comes with a cost, we need to become selfless and die to ourselves to become like Jesus. He took the hardest part the one that got Him killed for us so that we could gain merit through all He did for us. We need Grace and every day we need to seek that from Him. The more we allow ourselves to see and be reminded of the suffering Christ through meditation on His crucifixion the more it should make us aware of what He did for us on the cross. When He said Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. He begged God's Mercy on us, and as baptized Christians we are you all called to do that. Forgive as we are forgiven. We are all accountable to God for our actions. Let us remember the highest gift of His love and Mercy through Jesus Christ. 🙏🏻

##### AI-Generated Summary: The Call to Mirror God's Mercy

**Main Topics Discussed:** **\*God's Infinite Mercy:** The core message emphasizes God's boundless, ever-present mercy and forgiveness, freely offered to all who approach Him, regardless of their sins.\* **The Christian Obligation to Be Merciful:** Receiving God's immense forgiveness through Christ compels Christians to extend that same mercy and forgiveness to others. **\*The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18):** This parable serves as the central illustration, highlighting the hypocrisy and injustice of refusing to forgive small debts (offenses) after having received forgiveness for an enormous debt from God.\* **The Nature of True Forgiveness:** Forgiveness is presented not merely as a human act but as a supernatural one – a "God thing" – requiring divine grace. **\*The Process of Forgiveness:** Forgiveness is often a daily journey, not an instantaneous event, requiring constant reliance on God and prayer. **Key Takeaways:\*** We should never fear approaching God for forgiveness; His mercy is constant and freely given. _Receiving God's mercy comes with the profound responsibility to be merciful and forgiving towards others "from the heart."_ Our inability to forgive others is contrasted sharply with the magnitude of God's forgiveness towards us (illustrated by the parable and the nacho anecdote). _True, heartfelt forgiveness requires connecting with God's heart and relying on His grace daily, as human strength alone is insufficient._ Remembering the immensity of God's sacrifice and forgiveness (perhaps by meditating on a crucifix) can help us find the grace to forgive others. \*Forgiveness is often a process requiring daily prayer, asking for grace, echoing the Lord's Prayer ("forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us"). **Notable Quotes/Insights:\*** God's forgiveness is "constant and ever-new, freely flowing from His heart." _Mercy should "flow freely from our hearts just as it flows from God's."_ The unforgiving servant's lord revoking forgiveness underscores the seriousness of our call to forgive. _The personal nacho anecdote provides a relatable insight into the unexpected difficulty of sharing/showing mercy, even on a small scale._ "True forgiveness is supernatural, a 'God thing,' not merely human." \* Forgiveness is often a "journey, not an instant switch," requiring daily reliance on God. The message concludes with prayers (Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be) and a blessing, reinforcing the call to immerse oneself in God's mercy and seek His grace to live out this call to forgive

He goes in search of His sheep and He lays down His life for His sheep, Such is our God🙌🏼Our God is our deliverer and our only protection. These words in the "our Father" are given by the Father through Jesus to us. He wants us to "TRUST" Him and to know that He alone is the one who can and will save us.

We need to remind ourselves and renew our thinking each time we are tempted to stress and worry about situations in our lives that are beyond our control. Because Jesus came as the Good shepherd to provide, protect, defend, deliver and save us and that He died for us so that we may live.

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 14 - "BLESSED ARE YOU" Michelle Jackson

"Blesses are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, JESUS". these words found in scripture tell us that Mamma Mary was not like any other woman on the earth. She was God's most unique master piece. Chosen to bear Jesus, God in her womb. When our lady visited elizabeth, she was filled with the HolySpirit at her greeting and she cried out with a shout of Joy. Calling her blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Mamma Mary is the God bearer and the HolySpirit dwells in her. She gave us Jesus, and we need to ask for that grace to honour her as God did and as Elizabeth did. Lord help us to love and rejoice in the blessed mother as you love and rejoice in her.. and when we pray the Hail Mary may we encounter her in Joy, and be filled with the HolySpirit 😇🙏🏽

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 15 - "MOTHER OF GOD" Michelle Jackson

"Holy Mary, Mother of God , pray for us Sinners, now and at the hour of our death."So beautifully explained by Fr. Mark Mary, on the role and relationship of going through our Mother to Jesus. To understand that He led us through Scripture in the old testament about Adonijah who knows Queen Bathsheba ,and she knows the King, King Solomon her Son. Who goes with a request, and the Son even before knowing, says "of course I will grant it". If in the natural order things were the way they were so too the supernatural order reflects the natural. Here we know our Blessed Mother and She being the Mother of Jesus goes to Him each time we ask for her help, Jesus listens to her. More than granting our requests about situations we don't seem to understand, for it is our Soul she cares about even more. We entrust ourselves to her and ask her special protection and prayers for us at the hour of our death that is so precious and Jesus WILL grant her that request, because He loves Her and He loves us. 🙏🏽

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 16 - "GLORIFY HIM" Michelle Jackson

"Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning,is now and ever shall be world without end.Amen". All Praise and Glory be to the Holy Trinity. What is Praise? It is a form of prayer which recognises that God is God. It is right that we praise Him. It is to look to Him always, cause it is the right thing to do. It is for our own Good to Praise God, not for what he does but for who He is. He the maker of all things must be acknowledged by all, and Praised and Glorified by all. God is pleased when we do so not because He needs it,But because its right. When you Love Him and see how Faithful God is in your life you will begin to Praise Him. Cause everyday we are alive and its cause He wills it for us and we take that for granted. Let us Thank Him Throughout the day by asking for that grace
_Psalms 34:1- I will bless the LORD at all times : His praise shall continually be in my mouth._

Psalms 150:6- Let everything that has breath praise the Lord🙌🏼

##### Turn On The Light

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 17 - "Turn on the Light" Michelle Jackson

"IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLYSPIRIT - THE SIGN OF THE CROSS"
_The mystery of the most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian Faith and life , it is the mystery of God Himself. It also is the source of all other_ _mysteries of Faith, the Light that enlightens them._ \*Truly one needs Faith to understand that. We need to ask the HolySpirit for grace to See which God gives us through Baptism all through our lives. And when we make the sign of the cross we are opening our eyes to see Him, to see all of creation and all other mysteries in His light. Jesus Christ is the Light of the World and we need His light to guide us through, there are many other lights in this world to lead us astray, so to know and see the difference we need to understand the path we are taking if it leads us to Him or away from Him. May Christ' light be our light always. Jesus said whoever follows me shall never walk in darkness. _Hebrew 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would approach God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him._

Romans 10:17- So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 18 - "OUR SWEETNESS, OUR HOPE" Michelle Jackson

"Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our Sweetness and our Hope", what a beautiful way to put that Father Mark😇, as Jesus provided food for our journey to Eternal life, which is bread( Himself) when He instituted the Holy Eucharist and the wine His blood, which is sweet, and wine that is used to celebrate Joys in life, He adds that sweetness to our lives by giving us His Mother to be our Mother, and she truly gives us Joy when we go through her to Him. The warmth and love of a Mother He gave us all . The Mother of all Mothers. Thank you Yeshua for the gift Thy Mother. You did not hold back anything from us. You gave us Yourself fully, and also your Mother. How much our God loves us. Thank you for being our Mother Mamma Mary 🙏🏻

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 19 - "VALLEY OF TEARS" Michelle Jackson

"To thee do we cry poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears" . Our Lord who understands our pain and suffering and is always with us. He who died for us and suffered for us comes to comfort and consoles us when we suffer. We are never alone and in our misery, when He was on the cross He gave His beloved disciple His Mother and Her to Him. Our mother who suffered seeing her son betrayed and crucified and experienced extreme sorrow and pain, like the pain of a sword piercing her heart ,that much sorrow she felt and suffered, she understands us when we go through pain and suffering. She comforts and consoles us with Jesus. Our pain is precious to them. When we understand and know the value of pain and suffering we can unite it to the sufferings of Jesus and Mamma Mary to be sanctified and purified by it. We are never alone. Our Lord and Mother understands us when we cry and cannot pray, for our tears become our silent prayers. Thank Yeshua Thank you Mamma for your Love🙏🏽

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 20 - "Eyes of Mercy" Michelle Jackson

So beautifully put Father Mark. The Lord who understands the poverty of man and all He has to give, He accepts with love. The Holy Family poor as they were, offering what they could afford was pleasing to God. God understands and accepts all we give Him, as He understood the condition of the poor widow who offered all she had and put into the treasury. Comparing her to our blessed Mother was looking at it through humble eyes. Mamma Mary too accepts all we give to her even if it isn't the best we can or imperfect as it can be, she accepts it with love from her little children. Let us pray to desire to give our best to her. It's so comforting to know that even if we couldn't do our best in offering our prayers it's the heart she sees. Thank you Mamma Mary

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 21b- "Show unto us" Michelle Jackson

"And after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement,O loving O sweet Virgin Mary." Mother's know what to do, I love how Fr. Mike said our Lady understands us, she experiences our pain and our need and our sufferings and takes us to Jesus, as at the wedding at Cana ,when they had run out of wine, She told Jesus about the situation and when He said His time hadn't come yet She told the servants there to "do whatever He tells you". And Jesus did His first miracle. He obeyed His mamma, and so too for us she takes us to Jesus bringing us into a relationship with Him and tells us to do the same. Listen to Him, do what He tells you. Such a beautiful way of communication we are taught. And that's what prayer should be like. It should be that conversation. Let us ask for grace to speak and make known our requests and listen to what Jesus tells us to do...

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 22 - "LEAD SOULS TO HEAVEN" Michelle Jackson

That was an intense journey with Father Mike,on our own salvation and the salvation of our loved ones. God is Love and He desires Salvation of the whole World. More than we desire the salvation of our loved ones God is already pursuing us.\* _And for those gone astray, the Good shepherd goes in search, not wanting to lose even one. He searches and brings us back to His flock._ _He reveals His heart to those who respond and co-operate with His Will for mankind. He did reveal this to our blessed Mother of when she appeared to the 3 visionaries, to pray many Rosaries for poor sinners and taught them to pray a special prayer after every decade. So precious._ _Our life is precious, bought by the Blood Of The Lamb and we need to take that seriously asking grace to reflect on our life and our living. Does it please God?_ _Do we please Him or the World?Do we know our Worth?_
_When we die we either will go to heaven or hell._ \*How we live here, what we do now matters. Let us not be afraid but Trust God. We are Christians.and Christians are people of Hope. The Hope that comes from God Himself. Thank you Lord for Your Saving Grace and Your Love for us all. May the whole world respond to that grace and co-operate and desire our own salvation and the salvation of the whole world. May the whole world be Sanctified Sanctified and purified. Amen.

##### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 23 - "CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH" Michelle Jackson

"I Believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord." The Apostle's Creed is so beautiful, may they be a great reminder of the fullness of the truth and let them form our minds, but also fill our hearts. Such a wonderful way to reflect on the creed and meditate on them. As Father Mark took us through Job who struggles and complains and questions God,with his friends by his side provoking him, and God responds to him questioning him, were you there when I laid the foundations of the world? Now who dare talk back to God?how terrifying to hear God respond, God who is the Creator, the maker of all things ,who can even understand the why's or what's of what He does and why He does and for who He does what He does? Many times we play God, we don't trust Him enough and we want to control all things our way and how we want, we who Father Mark put it, can't make even one donkey, let alone a donkey , we can't make anything without something and get so upset and mad and question God when we don't see things going our way. Let us repent of this ungrateful attitude and quit playing God. Let God be God and let us surrender and submit to Him. God loves us, Jesus in the New testament understood the pain Mary felt at the death of her brother, and Jesus who knew that He could give back life to Lazarus . He said I am the Life, and the Resurrection, yet when He saw her crying, "He wept". God is all knowing we are not, God is God we are not, we cannot do anything without God. We wouldn't even have been here if He didn't Will us into existence. God Loves us, but do we.? Let us look around and see this wonderful World He created for you and me from the tiny little mite to the highest peak of a mountain top, the wisdom and love He put into it all is for us. Thank you Abba Father for being our God

##### Rosary in a Year - Day 30 - Joyful Mysteries

1. The Visitation - Luke 1:39-56
   Mary is the new Ark of the Covenant in the NT as She conceives Jesus, who is the high priest (staff in the old Ark of Covenant), the bread of life (Jar of manna in the old Ark of Covenant) and the fulfilment and the giver of the law (ten commandments). Mary is the new meeting tent through whom God meets his people and leads them to victory (Salvation).
   As David brings the Ark of Covenant back to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6) the New Ark ( Mary) visits Elizabeth. Just like David felt unworthy of being given the privilige of bringing the Ark back, so does Elizabeth feel unworthy of the Lord's mother coming to visit her.
   In the OT there singing and dancing in front of the Ark, likewise, John the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb hearing Mary's greeting.
   Let us be renewed in Joy.

The Joyful Mysteries
3\. The Nativity - Luke 2: 1-20
Joseph went to Bethlehem to enroll themselves as per the rule of Caesar Augustus and it was time for Mary to give birth. This was so that the prophesy of Micah (Micah 5:2) would be fulfilled, that from Bethlehem will come a ruler of Israel.
The angels appear to the poor shepherds who according to the Jewish culture were considered outside of God's covenant. This shows inclusion of all under God's Covenant.

4\. The Presentation of the Lord Jesus in the Temple - Luke 2:22-39
Jesus is presented in the temple after 40 days of being born, as per the custom. Joseph and Mary offer turtledoves which was the sacrifice to be offered by poor people for purity. Mary, on account of her immaculate conception and virgin birth need not have offered the sacrifice, but humbly followed the law.
Simeon and Anna who belonged to the old Covenant were awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. They rejoice on seeing Jesus who will be the light of the world, thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah (42:6 and 49:6).

5\. The finding of Lord Jesus in the temple - Luke 2:41-52
Jesus, along with his parents, makes the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the feast of the passover. Though it was obligatory for Jewish boys to make the pilgrimage at the age of 13, Jesus accompanies his father Joseph at the age of 12 in preparation for the following year. Mary is faithful in accompanying her spouse and son. This teaches us that our life on earth is a pilgrimage, we are all walking in faith towards being more holy.
Jesus was lost and found in 3 days, which was an indication of Mary losing him at Mt. Calvary and getting him back in 3 days.
Jesus stays back at the temple to fulfil filial obedience. With the same obedience he surrendered himself on the cross, so we could share inner oneness with God.

1. Baptism of Jesus Mathew 3:13-17

The mystery of the Holy Trinity is revealed as soon as Jesus is baptised at the Jordan. The Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, the Spirit of God, descends from heaven.
The river Jordan had a lot historic significance. It was the turning point for Joshua at the end of the Exodus. Prophet Elijah went up to heaven at the river Jordan, Prophet Elisha started his prophetic ministry at the river Jordan.

John's baptism was about beginning anew, reorienting one's life and preparing for the coming of the Messiah.
John through his baptism with water washed away sins and prepared the peoples' heart for the Messiah.
Jesus by dying on the cross, going to the tomb and resurrecting, washed away our sins to get us closer to His Father.

Nadya Baracho

###### Luminous Mysteries

1. The wedding at Cana John 2:1-12
   Jesus performs his first miracle. Mary's words 'do whatever he says' are also her last in the scripture. These words should echo with us in our daily lives in every situation.
   Jesus performs the miracle on the 7th day of his ministry. The number 7 indicates perfection, completion.
   At the wedding there were 6 jars filled with water (6 days of creation). These are turned to wine (fulfillment with the sabbath). The 6 jars filled by human hands are going to be completed, fulfilled, turned into wine by Jesus.
   The wedding at Cana was the first among the 7 signs he perfomed. The other signs were healing of the official's son, healing of the paralytic, multiplying of loaves, healing of the blind man, raising lazarus from death and His ressurection.
   Jesus is the new wine. He is the new creation, the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus is the divine bridegroom. Just as the bridegroom rejoices over his bride (Isaiah 62:5), Jesus rejoices over us, His people. He is the bridegroom who laid down His life for His bride - the Church. Jesus is inviting us to be in an intimate relationship with Him.

5\. The Institution of the Eucharist - Jesus tthe Bread of Life. Luke 22:14-23
Jesus institutes the new covenant at the last supper with his apostles. Just as the traditional passover revolved around the sacrifice of the lamb, the new passover revolves around the body and blood of Christ who was crucified for us. Jesus is the lamb of God who led us through the new Exodus from sin to freedom. He is the new manna which sustains us through our journey to the promised land. The bread blessed, broken and given becomes His flesh!
It is mandatory for us to eat his flesh to receive eternal life.

##### AI-Generated Summary: Mary's Pilgrimage of Faith: Contemplating the Fifth Sorrowful Mystery

This meditation centers on the Fifth Sorrowful Mystery, the Crucifixion of Jesus, drawing upon the writings of St. Alphonsus Liguori. It explores the profound depth of Mary's sorrow as she witnessed her son's suffering and death, highlighting her role not just as a grieving mother but as a model of faith, femininity, and maternity. The meditation invites listeners to join in contemplative prayer, using the image of Mary at the foot of the cross as a focal point for understanding the nature of faith, suffering, and divine love.

The core of the meditation lies in the depiction of Mary's experience at Calvary. It portrays her not as a passive observer, but as an active participant in her son's mission, albeit through silent, steadfast presence. Her unwavering faith is underscored by her acceptance of Jesus' suffering, a testament to her deep understanding of his divine purpose. Despite the unimaginable pain of witnessing her innocent son's crucifixion, Mary does not attempt to intervene or question God's plan. This acceptance, born from years of pondering and growing in faith, is presented as the culmination of her own spiritual journey.

The meditation traces Mary's "pilgrimage of faith," beginning with the Joyful Mysteries and emphasizing the Finding in the Temple episode. This event, where the young Jesus is found teaching in the temple, foreshadows his future mission and highlights Mary's continuous growth in understanding God's will. The meditation emphasizes that Mary, though immaculately conceived and free from original sin, was not exempt from the human experience of suffering. Her life, like ours, was a journey of faith, marked by both joy and sorrow, understanding and questioning. This relatable aspect of Mary's life makes her an even more powerful example for believers.

The meditation paints a vivid picture of Mary at the foot of the cross. She is heartbroken, yet resolute. Her eyes are fixed on Jesus, and it is suggested she continues to whisper the prayers and psalms that have always brought her comfort. This image of quiet strength and unwavering devotion in the face of immense suffering is central to the meditation's message. It emphasizes that true faith is not the absence of pain or doubt, but the ability to persevere even in the darkest of times, clinging to hope and trust in God.

The meditation also highlights the paradox of Mary's presence at Calvary. As the "all beautiful one," she stands witness to the brutal and ugly reality of crucifixion. This juxtaposition of beauty and suffering serves to amplify the power of the moment. It underscores the transformative potential of faith, which can find beauty even in the midst of pain and find strength even in the face of despair. The meditation invites us to "behold her and her son," suggesting that through contemplation of this scene, we can gain a deeper understanding of God's love and the redemptive power of suffering.

The meditation emphasizes Mary's role not just as the Mother of God, but as the ultimate example of femininity and maternity. Her unwavering love and support for her son, even in his final moments, are presented as the epitome of maternal devotion. This aspect of the meditation connects with the broader theme of Mary as a role model for all believers, regardless of gender. Her strength, compassion, and unwavering faith are qualities to be emulated by all who seek to follow Christ.

The inclusion of traditional prayers like the Hail Mary and the Glory Be further reinforces the meditative and devotional nature of the piece. The repetition of the Hail Mary serves to deepen the connection with Mary and invite the listener into a state of prayerful contemplation. The concluding expression of gratitude for joining in prayer reinforces the sense of community and shared spiritual experience.

In essence, this meditation offers a profound reflection on the Fifth Sorrowful Mystery, going beyond a simple recounting of events to explore the deeper spiritual significance of Mary's presence at the crucifixion. It invites listeners to contemplate Mary's journey of faith, her unwavering devotion, and her role as a model of strength, femininity, and maternity. By focusing on Mary's experience, the meditation offers a powerful and moving perspective on the meaning of suffering, the nature of faith, and the transformative power of divine love.

##### AI-Generated Summary: The Hidden Power and Divinity of the Holy Spirit

This reflection delves into the Third Glorious Mystery, the Descent of the Holy Spirit, drawing heavily upon the wisdom of St. Ambrose's _On the Holy Spirit_. The core message revolves around the often-hidden nature of the Holy Spirit, whose power and divinity are revealed not through overt displays, but through the subtle yet transformative work of unveiling Christ and uniting us with him. While Pentecost offers a more visible manifestation of the Spirit, the reflection emphasizes the importance of recognizing and honoring the Spirit's continuous, often unseen, activity in our lives. One of the key takeaways is the profound unity within the Trinity.

The Holy Spirit is not a separate entity or a temporary replacement for Jesus, but rather fully God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son. This unity is emphasized through the analogy of the Father sending both his Word (Jesus) and his breath (the Holy Spirit). The Spirit's role is intrinsically linked to Christ, revealing him to us and disposing our hearts to receive him in faith. This interconnectedness highlights the Trinity's collaborative work in salvation. The reflection underscores that the Spirit’s presence doesn't signify diversity within the Godhead, but rather demonstrates the unified power of the divine. This "fire" of the Spirit refines our good deeds and consumes our sins, further solidifying the transformative power of the Trinity working within us. The reflection also explores the intriguing paradox of the Holy Spirit's hiddenness.

While deserving of worship and adoration as God, the Spirit's mission involves a certain self-effacement. The Spirit does not speak on his own but reveals the Father's word, pointing us always towards Jesus and the Father. This divine humility allows us to focus on the message of salvation without being distracted by the messenger. We come to know the Holy Spirit not through direct, sensational experiences, but through the fruits of his labor: the unveiling of Christ, the growth of faith, hope, and charity within us, and our increasing conformity to Jesus. The reflection emphasizes that while much of our prayer naturally focuses on Jesus and the Father's word, acknowledging the Holy Spirit's power and divinity remains crucial.
This acknowledgment involves recognizing the Spirit's constant, often unseen, work in our lives. Just as the Spirit revealed Christ to the apostles at Pentecost, the Spirit continues to reveal Christ to us, guiding us towards deeper union with him. The Pentecost event, with its dramatic imagery of tongues of fire, serves as a powerful reminder of the Spirit's active presence and transformative power. It is a moment to not only adore the Holy Spirit but also to thank him for the hidden work he performs in shaping us into the image of Christ. A notable insight from the reflection is the distinction between the Spirit's presence and our experience of it. The Spirit is always present, actively working within us, even when we are not consciously aware of it. This highlights the importance of faith and trust in the Spirit's continuous action, even in the absence of tangible feelings or experiences. The reflection encourages us to cultivate a deeper awareness of the Spirit's subtle influence in our lives, recognizing his hand in our growing faith, hope, and love. The reflection concludes with the Lord's Prayer and three Hail Marys, emphasizing the importance of prayer in fostering a relationship with the Trinity. These prayers, directed towards the Father and acknowledging the role of Mary, further underscore the interconnectedness within the Godhead and the importance of seeking communion with the divine. The inclusion of these prayers serves as a practical application of the reflection's message, encouraging us to actively engage with the Trinity through prayer and cultivate a deeper awareness of the Holy Spirit's hidden yet powerful presence in our lives. The reflection encourages us to not only acknowledge the Spirit's divinity but also to actively seek his guidance and grace in our daily lives, trusting in his transformative power to conform us ever more closely to the image of Christ.
