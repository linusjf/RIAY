### AI-Generated Summary: The Poverty of Unseeing Prayer

What we find here is not the rich tapestry of devotion but a barren repetition, like a child reciting words without grasping their meaning. The soul, when it prays, ought to ascend—yet these empty phrases circle the same ground, like a bird fluttering near the earth but never taking wing. One wonders if the speaker mistakes the act of saying for the act of praying, as if Heaven could be moved by mere syllables rather than the heart’s true cry.

And what of art? There is none here—no vision, no form, no color to stir the mind toward higher things. For beauty, too, is a kind of prayer, a silent hymn to the Maker of all things. But where beauty is absent, the soul grows thin, feeding only on the dry husks of habit. Let us then seek both prayer and art with fresh eyes, lest we starve while standing at the feast.
