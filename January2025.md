### Responding to God

[![Responding to God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day001.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PesisPSBosg "Responding to God")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro *when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope.*
*What we believe in should change us*
*Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God*
*Our body and soul should connect when we pray*
*Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us*ü•π
*We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.*
*We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thankyou Lord for this relationship you give us through prayer*üôèüèΩ

### The King Knows You

[![The King Knows You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lW9LA2uYhp0 "The King Knows You")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 02 Michelle Jackson

*The King knows "you/me"*
*This is so personal for me*ü•π *The king of the universe knows me even before i was knit in my mother's womb,*  *He knows the very number of hairs on my head,* *how precious and heart striking it is to know that.* *The King sees me, the King Knows me, the King "Loves" to hear my voice* ‚ù§‚Äçüî• *and the King knows my name* ü•∞üòç
*My God My God how I love Thee. This way of praying having the image of Him in our hearts when we pray is something so precious, we see ourselves and feel so unworthy while all along He looks at us in Love.* *Thankyou Jesus.*
*i once asked Jesus while at a retreat to call to my name aloud and He did while it was on the last day of the retreat we were all having a JAM dance (Jesus and me) in the midst of all the music and loud noise I heard  someone call my name it was clear and soft I asked my husband if he called my name and he said no and I knew it at once it was Jesus who called my name. So yes ,* *The King knows me/ the King knows you/ the King knows each of us by name* üòáü•π‚ù§‚Äçüî•

### Day 2 - Michael Eltham

A good pairing to today‚Äôs episode ‚ÄúThe King knows you‚Äù would be to read and ponder on Psalm 139.

LORD, you have probed me, you know me: you know when I sit and stand;
you understand my thoughts from afar.

You sift through my travels and my rest;
with all my ways you are familiar.

Even before a word is on my tongue,
LORD, you know it all.

Behind and before you encircle me
and rest your hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
far too lofty for me to reach.

Where can I go from your spirit?
From your presence, where can I flee?

If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
if I lie down in Sheol, there you are.
If I take the wings of dawn
and dwell beyond the sea,

Even there your hand guides me,
your right hand holds me fast.

If I say, ‚ÄúSurely darkness shall hide me,
and night shall be my light‚Äù\*‚Äî

Darkness is not dark for you,
and night shines as the day.
Darkness and light are but one.d

You formed my inmost being;
you knit me in my mother‚Äôs womb.

I praise you, because I am wonderfully made;
wonderful are your works!

My very self you know.
My bones are not hidden from you,

When I was being made in secret,
fashioned in the depths of the earth.

Your eyes saw me unformed;
in your book all are written down;
my days were shaped, before one came to be.

It is good to simply be held by our Father, to rest in His bosom. Knowing that He is always watching over us and we are precious to Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### Heart of Jesus

[![Heart of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day003.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KiLJc32YPKg "Heart of Jesus")

### RIAY Day 3 Heart of Jesus Michael Eltham

Working in corporate America often feels like being caught in a relentless race‚Äîstriving to be the best, fastest, most accurate, and efficient. The pressure to complete tasks quickly and be the first to market can overshadow the joy and love for the work itself. However, today‚Äôs episode of Jesus in St. Joseph‚Äôs Workshop was a profound reminder: Jesus has been with me all along, accompanying me in every moment of my work life.

He sees me in my failures, encourages me when I feel like giving up, rejoices in my successes, and prays for me in moments of complacency.

Let us invite Jesus and St. Joseph into our daily work. With their presence, the labor of our hands will be blessed, and even the most mundane tasks will regain their purpose and meaning.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### RIAY Day 3 - Marcy

So grateful for the RIAY.
Being in the workshop with Jesus as my teacher today was just awesome üëå.  I was not anxious,  nervous or afraid but was excited that now I am really going to get it right. I am not in a hurry, I will be patient, I will do my best to listen and follow the instructions, even when a heavy tool falls on my toe or if I miss the target and bash my fingers üòâ,  I will dance to the pain till it cools off and will continue trying till I get it right. üôè

### Rosary IN A YEAR DAY 03- Heart of Jesus Michelle Jackson

*Jesus who are You?*
*Jesus, What is Your heart like?*
*Jesus, what is Your heart like to me?*
*Jesus is my safe space, my home, my heaven, my best friend, my hope, my life, my saviour, my EVERYTHING. The very meaning of my life*‚ù§‚Äçüî•
Yes Jesus' heart is full of Patience and Mercy
I see myself like a child in His workshop and inspite of Him giving me instructions i keep interrupting Him and asking if i'm doing well and all i see is He smiles back at me , im in a hurry but He is not, He's full of Love and I feel so safe and free to be myself that even though i'm messing up He's not angry or upset. Im trying to keep up, looking at what He's doing but i don't seem to match n i cry , and just then He tells me His secret, that He loves spending time with me and loves it that i'm spending time with Him.  And that's what Mamma told Him, that we need to spend time together.üò≠‚ù§‚Äçüî•ü•π It melts my heart hearing that, i drop the tools and jump onto Him and He embraces me.
This picture within is so real the truth to it all - Jesus and i in His workshop,was not for what i came for but that i came to be with Him and He values that so much.
Jesus values the time we give to Him even though we may not know now or feel it strongly, but we will know it once we enter into that personal relationship with Him ,which He waits for eagerly. Shalom.üôèüèΩüèº

### RIAY Day 3 - Gavril

"Mom wants us to spend time together more than she wants these new candlesticks. In fact, just us spending time together is the greatest gift we can give to her"
This was the most beautiful line in the meditationü•π

### Prayer With Mercy

[![Prayer With Mercy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day004.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZeY21DCQZzI "Prayer With Mercy")

### RIAY Day 4/ 04- 01- 2025

*Praying with Mary*
Immaculate Heart of Mary beside the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a picture frame has been in my heart and home for like forever. Yet it took me a minute to focus on a picture of Mother Mary to pray.
Very beautifully reflected upon by Fr... Mary was actively involved in the growth of her Son Jesus in every aspect Mind Body and Spirit, her own beloved Son..and then John her second beloved son...then San Juan " Am I not your mother?" And the list can go on...

God our loving Father I pray today for myself and all Catholics who have taken Our Blessed Mother Mary for granted and for all who have turned their back on her. *may we understand that we cannot and never will be able to love her more than Jesus did*
May we receive grace everyday through her maternal intercession. Amen.
Poco poco Fr Mark. God bless you too. Thankyou. üôèüèª

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 04 - PRAYER WITH MARY - Michelle Jackson

The depth of Mamma Mary mirroring the Light of Christ, and the reflection of our God in her, the way Father Mark put that sounded simple but was deep, it calls us to understand that slowly by slowly layer by layer, she mothered what was asked of her she took it all in and did what was asked of her she even went beyond when she took st John to be her son now, what a responsible son Jesus is handing over His beloved Mother to His disciple not wanting her to be alone, and he becomes her son and She his Mother. i believe that they are here with me at home. Greeting Mamma and Jesus when we leave home and return feels like we're never alone. It's a deep relationship, with  our Mother who never leaves our side. In the words of Mother Teresa, she asks when we feel low or lonely ask Mamma to be a Mother to me now and knowing she always has and will be, is such a gift from God our Father and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. üôèüèΩMamma Mary bring all the lost to Jesus.  Let those who have never experienced a mother's love feel yours strongly. Amen Shalom

### A Garden of Rest

[![A Garden of Rest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day005.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IhrhpVelcbc "A Garden of Rest")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 5 - A GARDEN OF REST ( MARY, MOTHER INVIOLATE) Michelle Jackson

*Woaw that was a beautiful Walk, a safe place,  a locked garden where the world can't get it. Walking in this garden with Mamma is so beautiful, this is such a big garden with so many varieties of Roses and they are so fragrant, our rosaries are not prayers to be completed but it's a mystical garden, where we speak to mamma tell her how we weary, what burdens we bear, how hard life is and when we feel all discouraged she speaks so warmly so lovingly she says " am I not here? I who am your mother, what more does a child need ü•π so True! So many roses to offer her for Jesus , she takes us along this garden through all those mysteries, and they are so beautiful so deep so meaningful so true something one can experience if one desires it genuinely. With Mary the battle ground of life is transformed into a garden enclosed. I love that. May all who pray the rosary experience its sweetness. Amen, Ave Maria*üåπ

### Prayer is a Battle

[![Prayer is a Battle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day006.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UTyod-E1AHA "Prayer is a Battle")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 6 - PRAYER IS A BATTLE - Michelle Jackson

Prayer is a weapon to disarm the evil one, the very thoughts he tempts us with especially when we begin to pray shows clear signs he's always around. As 1 Peter 5:8 says -Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. And Ephesians 6: 11&12 says , put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil, for we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies but against the principalities against powers against the world  rulers of this present darkness , against the spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places. (Defeats him).We need grace and God's armor of protection when we pray, we need to ask our Holy Angels to pray with us and  keep watch over us when we begin to pray. Prayer changes everything if we allow it to change us, we need to trust and surrender to God when we pray. Prayer is the health of our soul and living on this earth. We need to cooperate with the Holy Spirit when we pray, we pray and need to listen as well,  prayer truly wages war on the inside cause we are weak and vulnerable but we need to defeat that by using the Word of God at all times. st. Alphonsus' says "Those who pray are certainly saved, those who do not are damned, !! so deep. May the HolySpirit reawaken in us. Amen\*

### Grace Will Overflow

[![Grace Will Overflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day007.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Yz2_NEmpF-c "Grace Will Overflow")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 07 - "GRACE WILL OVERFLOW" - Michelle Jackson

*"The Rosary is a source of Grace", as in the words of Mother Teresa - "Not all of us can do great things, but  we can all do small things with great love" we may not be heroic in changing the world and setting new records but with prayers have an imoact, prayers can go where we can't. The Rosary truly purifies and sanctifies us and brings us immense graces when we commit ourselves to spend time with Jesus and Mamma Mary. Today will be 7 days i started praying the 4 Rosaries and i must testify the number of graces I receive through them.ü•π So many signal graces so many blessings and so much of Joy praying them. Let us commit ourselves to pray the Rosary for our families and the whole world to be sanctified, and that we all come to Jesus through Mary. The world needs grace, the world needs Jesu,  and this much we can do by praying the Rosary and offering them through our Lady to Jesus.  Nothing is lost when given to God. The sacrifice we make and must make will bring us fruit. Ave Maria*üôèüèΩ
