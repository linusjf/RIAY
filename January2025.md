### Responding to God

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 01 Michelle Jackson

Thank God for this blessing, i love the intro *when the evil one accuses us he leaves us hopeless and helpless but when the HolySpirit convicts us of our sin He always leads us to Hope.*
*What we believe in should change us*
*Prayer doesn't help our relationship with God, prayer "is" our relationship with God*
*Our body and soul should connect when we pray*
*Most importantly it's raising our heart and mind to God by making an act of Faith by which we look at Him who is "always" looking at us, listening to us and loving us*ü•π
*We need to practice His presence by recognising His presence, He's always there.*
*We need to give our all when we pray it's not one sided it's a relationship, we need to listen after we speak. Thankyou Lord for this relationship you give us through prayer*üôèüèΩ

### The King Knows You

[![The King Knows You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/RIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lW9LA2uYhp0 "The King Knows You")

### ROSARY IN A YEAR DAY 02 Michelle Jackson

*The King knows "you/me"*
*This is so personal for me*ü•π *The king of the universe knows me even before i was knit in my mother's womb,*  *He knows the very number of hairs on my head,* *how precious and heart striking it is to know that.* *The King sees me, the King Knows me, the King "Loves" to hear my voice* ‚ù§‚Äçüî• *and the King knows my name* ü•∞üòç
*My God My God how I love Thee. This way of praying having the image of Him in our hearts when we pray is something so precious, we see ourselves and feel so unworthy while all along He looks at us in Love.* *Thankyou Jesus.*
*i once asked Jesus while at a retreat to call to my name aloud and He did while it was on the last day of the retreat we were all having a JAM dance (Jesus and me) in the midst of all the music and loud noise I heard  someone call my name it was clear and soft I asked my husband if he called my name and he said no and I knew it at once it was Jesus who called my name. So yes ,* *The King knows me/ the King knows you/ the King knows each of us by name* üòáü•π‚ù§‚Äçüî•

### Day 2 - Michael Eltham

A good pairing to today‚Äôs episode ‚ÄúThe King knows you‚Äù would be to read and ponder on Psalm 139.

LORD, you have probed me, you know me: you know when I sit and stand;
you understand my thoughts from afar.

You sift through my travels and my rest;
with all my ways you are familiar.

Even before a word is on my tongue,
LORD, you know it all.

Behind and before you encircle me
and rest your hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
far too lofty for me to reach.

Where can I go from your spirit?
From your presence, where can I flee?

If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
if I lie down in Sheol, there you are.
If I take the wings of dawn
and dwell beyond the sea,

Even there your hand guides me,
your right hand holds me fast.

If I say, ‚ÄúSurely darkness shall hide me,
and night shall be my light‚Äù\*‚Äî

Darkness is not dark for you,
and night shines as the day.
Darkness and light are but one.d

You formed my inmost being;
you knit me in my mother‚Äôs womb.

I praise you, because I am wonderfully made;
wonderful are your works!

My very self you know.
My bones are not hidden from you,

When I was being made in secret,
fashioned in the depths of the earth.

Your eyes saw me unformed;
in your book all are written down;
my days were shaped, before one came to be.

It is good to simply be held by our Father, to rest in His bosom. Knowing that He is always watching over us and we are precious to Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### Heart of Jesus

### RIAY Day 3 Heart of Jesus Michael Eltham

Working in corporate America often feels like being caught in a relentless race‚Äîstriving to be the best, fastest, most accurate, and efficient. The pressure to complete tasks quickly and be the first to market can overshadow the joy and love for the work itself. However, today‚Äôs episode of Jesus in St. Joseph‚Äôs Workshop was a profound reminder: Jesus has been with me all along, accompanying me in every moment of my work life.

He sees me in my failures, encourages me when I feel like giving up, rejoices in my successes, and prays for me in moments of complacency.

Let us invite Jesus and St. Joseph into our daily work. With their presence, the labor of our hands will be blessed, and even the most mundane tasks will regain their purpose and meaning.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### RIAY Day 3 - Marcy

So grateful for the RIAY.
Being in the workshop with Jesus as my teacher today was just awesome üëå.  I was not anxious,  nervous or afraid but was excited that now I am really going to get it right. I am not in a hurry, I will be patient, I will do my best to listen and follow the instructions, even when a heavy tool falls on my toe or if I miss the target and bash my fingers üòâ,  I will dance to the pain till it cools off and will continue trying till I get it right. üôèüèº
