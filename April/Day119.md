St. Hilary of Poitiers (c. 315-368), a convert from paganism, staunchly defended the divinity of Christ against the Arian heresy. This Doctor of the Church, sometimes called the "Athanasius of the West," endured exile for his beliefs, yet his influence persisted, notably in his student, St. Martin of Tours.

Hilary, recognizing the Gospels as the unified voice of the one Spirit, particularly esteemed John's spiritual insight. This meditation, reflecting on the first sorrowful mystery and Hilary's thought, centers on Christ's love "to the end." While John alludes to Gethsemane, he doesn't detail the prayer itself. Instead, the focus shifts to John 17, the high priestly prayer. Here, even as betrayal looms, Christ intercedes not for himself, but for his apostles, recognizing them as a gift from the Father, consecrated in truth.

This selfless act, even in the face of unimaginable suffering, reveals the heart of Christ. Unlike our human tendency towards self-preservation in times of trial, Jesus, echoing his boyhood dedication in the temple and his resistance to temptation in the desert, remains fixed on the Father's will and the world's salvation. This unwavering love, demonstrated throughout his life, culminates in his ultimate sacrifice.

Gethsemane, then, becomes not just a place of agony, but a school of love. It calls us to imitate Christ's selflessness, turning our gaze outward, towards God and neighbor, especially when our own crosses feel heaviest. Like the oft-repeated prayers woven through this reflection – the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be – and the whispered plea, "not my will but yours be done," we are invited to deny ourselves, take up our daily crosses, and learn to love as he loved us.

Finally, with a spirit of shared devotion, gratitude is expressed for the communion of prayer, anticipating its renewal and offering a blessing to all who have joined in this meditation.
