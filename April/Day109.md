### AI-Generated Summary: The Wonder of the Annunciation

- Here is offered a quiet moment, a session for prayer with the Rosary, seeking a deeper acquaintance with Our Lord and His Mother, and to draw upon grace.
- Our focus falls upon the first Joyful Mystery, the Annunciation, guided by the venerable Saint Gregory, known rightly as the Wonderworker.
- This Gregory, a Bishop of the third century, saw God's power manifest not only in miracles but in the astonishing growth of his small Christian flock, a testament to the Spirit's work.
- He directs our gaze to that singular moment: the Annunciation, where God's ancient promise, long debated and yearned for by Israel, was at last unveiled.
- Consider Israel's long waiting, their hopes for a Deliverer, often perhaps clouded by earthly notions of kingship or conquest.
- Then Gabriel arrives, not with earthly power, but with a message for a humble Virgin: that she would bear the Son of the Highest, the true King whose reign would have no end, conceived by the Spirit.
- Herein lies the profound Mystery, hidden for ages, now made visible: God Himself, the very Maker of the stars, stooping down to become a man within His own creation.
- This act, the Incarnation announced at that moment, is the true Wonder, the source of freedom and forgiveness, far surpassing any human expectation.
- Let us, therefore, look upon this moment anew, not as a familiar tale, but with fresh gratitude and awe for the Advent of the Messiah, the very core of our hope.
- The session, a simple turning towards this truth, concludes with prayers, a humble response to such astonishing reality.
