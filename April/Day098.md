### AI-Generated Summary: The Abyss of Love and the Gift

Let us turn our thoughts, for a moment, to that most central Mystery: the giving of Himself in the Eucharist. Our guide in this brief contemplation is the redoubtable Catherine of Siena, a soul plunged deep into Divine conversation, who lived and laboured mightily in a distant age (1347-1380). She was a Dominican sister, though not cloistered, whose life was marked by profound vision and practical service to the poor and powerful alike. Her great work, the "Dialogue," records her spiritual converse with God.

The heart of our meditation rests upon words God spoke to her soul, revealing the _why_ behind His gifts: "because I love you so much."

- The very fount of this Mystery, we are told, is an 'abyss' – bottomless, unquenchable – of God's sheer, unyielding love for His creation, a love likened to a parent's deepest affection for a child.
- In response to our need, this boundless love pours forth the Eucharist, the "sweet truth as food," a Gift born from the very depths of God's burning heart, given for our salvation.
- We are called to consider this Gift, especially if familiarity has bred indifference. Imagine yourself before the Blessed Sacrament, or even present at that Last Supper, meeting the gaze of the Giver, hearing His longing expressed: "I love you so much."
- The fitting response is simple, yet profound: a heartfelt "thank you" and a sincere "I love you too," perhaps coupled with repentance for any coldness or ingratitude shown towards such a tremendous act of love.
- Such contemplation naturally leads the soul to articulate its thanks and love through prayer, turning the heart back towards the Giver of the Gift.
