### AI-Generated Summary: The Kingdom and the New Law of Love

Well now, let us consider that pivotal moment, the third luminous mystery, when the King Himself stepped forth not merely to claim His throne, but to declare the very nature of His reign and the peculiar demands it makes upon its subjects. This is the Proclamation of the Kingdom and the Call to Conversion.

Think of it thus: a new Kingdom requires a new law, and this law, unlike the old, springs not from fear or obligation, but from a radical, utterly new sort of Love.

- As the wise Augustine observed, perhaps the mountain where Christ delivered His great sermon signifies not just a place, but a higher plane of righteousness. The old precepts, given perhaps for a people guided by necessary fear towards an earthly promise, were good indeed. But the new law, for a people freed by Love and destined for a heavenly Kingdom, is _greater_. The same God, you see, provides precepts fitting for the time and the people.
- So, Jesus stands as the Lawgiver of this new realm. He contrasts the old ways with His own startling pronouncements: "You have heard it said... _But I say to you..._" He lifts the standard higher, infinitely higher. Mercy, forgiveness, love even for enemies â€“ these are the demanding, yet beautiful, coin of His realm.
- Now, one might feel a chill of discouragement here. How can mere mortals possibly meet such a standard? Ah, but here is the glorious secret! This capacity does not come from our own strained efforts. It flows, quite naturally, from the new Love He Himself bestows. It's rather like how a deep love for a child utterly transforms parents, enabling sacrifices and generosity they might never have imagined before. The _action_ changes because the _love_ has changed.
- This Love is nothing less than a revelation of God Himself, seen in Christ. And by His grace, through the indwelling Spirit, this new Love is written upon our very hearts. The Holy Spirit empowers us, brings us into this Kingdom, and enables us to live its demanding, beautiful law.
- So, when the demands of this new life seem daunting, remember that the power is not ours alone. It is Christ living through us, by the Spirit. The task, then, is simply to ask for that grace, to be filled with this divine Love, and so learn to love as He loved.
