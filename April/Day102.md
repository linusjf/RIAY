### AI-Generated Summary: The Burden and the Throne

Herein lies a brief account of a spiritual exercise, a pause for prayer and contemplation, guided by a Franciscan Friar, aimed at drawing souls nearer to the Lord Jesus and His Blessed Mother, and thereby, perhaps, channeling a trickle of grace into the thirsty world.

The heart of this reflection turns towards that sorrowful mystery where the King of Glory, though innocent, shoulders the very instrument of His execution – the Carrying of the Cross. Our guide in this contemplation is none other than Saint Josemaria Escriva, a modern champion, as it were, for that ancient truth that holiness is not merely for cloistered saints but for every soul wrestling with the dust and duties of ordinary life.

From Saint Josemaria's meditations, we glean a profound insight concerning this heavy burden:

- **The Paradox of Love:** That the Cross, the very symbol of suffering and ignominy, can, through the alchemy of Love, be transformed utterly, becoming not a burden to be endured begrudgingly, but a throne from which the Lord reigns.
- **The Tale of Three Crosses:** Consider the three crosses borne to Golgotha that day. Two were hoisted upon men by force, symbols of their just condemnation, carried perhaps with curses and despair, offering no redemption. But the third, though physically alike, was borne by the Innocent One, embraced freely, _for love_. This willing, loving carriage transmuted wood and weight into the very vehicle of Mercy's triumph. One led to death, another to salvation (for a repentant thief), but the one carried _in Love_ became the Throne from which salvation flowed.
- **Our Own Burdens:** The invitation, then, is to look upon our own crosses – the trials, the weariness, the unexpected sorrows – not as mere impositions to be resented, but as potential thrones. It is to seek the grace to embrace them, not with stoic resignation, but with the very Love that empowered Christ.
- **Suffering With, Reigning With:** For it is in carrying our crosses _with_ Him, in Love, that we suffer _with_ Him, die _with_ Him, and thus, are promised the astonishing privilege of reigning _with_ Him forever.

The session, after dwelling on this transforming truth, grounded itself in the familiar rhythm of common prayers – the Hail Mary, the Glory Be, the Sign of the Cross – binding hearts together in shared petition and praise. It is a simple, yet profound, path offered: to meet our own small burdens with the great Love that made the Cross of Christ a Throne of Glory.
