### AI-Generated Summary: The Visitation, Humility, and the Pursuit of Grace

The Rosary's Visitation, where Mary visits Elizabeth, offers a potent image of humility and grace. St. Ambrose highlights Mary's lowliness, though bearing Christ, in greeting her elder first. This echoes Christ later sanctifying John's baptismâ€”the greater seeking the lesser. Mary's presence instantly bears fruit: John leaps, and Elizabeth receives the Holy Spirit.

- Mary's visit becomes a conduit of grace, heard by Elizabeth and remarkably, perceived by John in the womb.
- This awareness of grace is key. A tale illustrates this: a younger friar, vexed by an older friar's distraction during charity work, receives a double apology. The second, exceeding mere politeness, prioritizes their relationship over rightness, a mark of true seniority, of being the "better" brother.

God, like Mary, persistently seeks us, occupying the lowest place to reach us. He doesn't discard us for our flaws but pursues us with relentless mercy.

- The Visitation exemplifies this: the superior (Mary, carrying Christ) comes to the aid of the inferior (Elizabeth and John).
- We, too, are called to this divine humility, offering patient, merciful, and persevering help to those struggling around us.

Woven throughout are the familiar refrains of the Hail Mary and Glory Be, culminating in thanks for shared prayer.
