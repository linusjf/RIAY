### AI-Generated Summary: The Ark Taken Home

Consider, if you will, the Fourth Glorious Mystery, that of Mary's Assumption. This is not merely a pious tale, but a truth understood through the grand tapestry of God's design, woven throughout Scripture, both Old and New. It speaks of Mary's return, body and soul, to her eternal dwelling place, her true Home.

To grasp this, let us look back. Remember the Ark of the Covenant? That sacred chest, God's dwelling place among His people, overshadowed by the Glory Cloud. It held the Law, the priestly staff, the heavenly bread – tokens of God's presence and provision. It was holy, set apart.

Now, turn your gaze to Mary. When the Angel came, the Glory Cloud returned, overshadowing _her_. She became the new Ark, carrying within her not symbols, but the very reality: Jesus, the new Law written on hearts, the eternal High Priest, the true Bread of Life. It is a striking parallel, long pondered by devout minds. Just as King David danced before the old Ark, bringing it to Jerusalem with great joy, so too does the New David, Christ Himself, desire His new Ark – Mary – to be with Him in the heavenly Jerusalem.

The old Ark, being holy, was treated with immense reverence. How much more so Mary, the living Ark, filled with grace and bearing God Himself? It seems fitting, indeed necessary, that this most holy vessel should not suffer decay but be brought entirely, body and soul, into the heavenly temple. And is this not precisely what the vision in Revelation hints at? When the temple in heaven is opened, the Ark of the Covenant is seen, followed immediately by the sign of the Woman clothed with the sun. Many have seen in this a glimpse of Mary, the new Ark, in her glorified state.

Though formally defined in recent times, this belief is ancient, echoing through the ages in the words of saints who spoke of the "holy living Ark" entering the "Heavenly Sanctuary." Mary, already full of grace, already living in profound union with God, is now fully glorified, her whole being sharing in Christ's victory over death. And this, dear friends, offers us immense hope. Her destiny is a foretaste of our own promised inheritance, a call for us to follow her path towards that same glorious Home. Let us celebrate her triumph and take heart in the journey before us.
