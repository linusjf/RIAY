### AI-Generated Summary: The King's Ascent and Our New Place

Consider the scene: the Lord Jesus, having shown Himself alive after death for forty days, leads His friends out towards Bethany. There, He lifts His hands, blesses them, and as He does so, He is taken away from them, lifted up into the sky until they can see Him no more. But mark this well: they do not return to Jerusalem weeping. No, they return with great joy, praising God continually. Why joy? Because this was not a departure, but an arrival – the arrival of the King in His own country, the Father’s house.

Think of it this way:

- **More than Leaving:** The Ascension is not merely Jesus going away, like a ship sailing over the horizon. It is His glorious entry into a new state of being, a "new Exodus" into the very heart of God's reality.
- **The King Takes His Throne:** The ancient promise of Psalm 110, "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand'," finds its fulfillment here. Sitting at God's right hand isn't about finding a chair in a specific corner of the universe; it signifies authority, power, and participation in God's divine dominion. Jesus returns to this place of ultimate authority and presence.
- **God and Space:** We often imagine God _in_ space, like a very large person somewhere out there. But God is not contained _by_ space; He is the ground _of_ space. His presence is divine, not spatial. Jesus, who lived within our spatial limitations, now passes _through_ them into the Father's boundless, divine presence.
- **Our Place in Him:** Here is the wonder! By taking His human body into this divine realm, Jesus has, as it were, carved out a space for humanity within God's own life. The Ascension means that through Him, we now have a new, glorified access to the Father.
- **Hope for the Journey:** This event opens the door to a future where justice reigns, tears are wiped away, and creation itself is renewed. It assures us that our faith is not in vain, offering courage and strength for our earthly pilgrimage, knowing that eternal life, a place with the Father, is offered to us through Christ. It is a journey we share, sustained by prayer and fellowship, looking towards that glorious reality.
