1. The wedding at Cana John 2:1-12
   Jesus performs his first miracle. Mary's words 'do whatever he says' are also her last in the scripture. These words should echo with us in our daily lives in every situation.
   Jesus performs the miracle on the 7th day of his ministry. The number 7 indicates perfection, completion.
   At the wedding there were 6 jars filled with water (6 days of creation). These are turned to wine (fulfillment with the sabbath). The 6 jars filled by human hands are going to be completed, fulfilled, turned into wine by Jesus.
   The wedding at Cana was the first among the 7 signs he perfomed. The other signs were healing of the official's son, healing of the paralytic, multiplying of loaves, healing of the blind man, raising lazarus from death and His ressurection.
   Jesus is the new wine. He is the new creation, the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus is the divine bridegroom. Just as the bridegroom rejoices over his bride (Isaiah 62:5), Jesus rejoices over us, His people. He is the bridegroom who laid down His life for His bride - the Church. Jesus is inviting us to be in an intimate relationship with Him.

### AI-Generated Summary: The Wedding Feast and the Divine Bridegroom

Prayer, particularly with the Rosary, serves as a profound means to deepen our bond with Jesus and Mary, drawing down grace upon the world. One such mystery pondered is the Wedding at Cana, recorded in John Chapter 2, a passage rich with layers of meaning waiting to be uncovered.

**A Moment of Profound Timing:**

The event occurs "on the third," a seemingly simple note yet one pregnant with significance. Scholars observe it marks the third period after Jesus' initial encounters and, more profoundly, points forward to His resurrection on the third day, both revealing His glory. Furthermore, by counting the preceding days in John's narrative, Cana falls on the seventh period, a number deeply symbolic of completion and new creation, signalling Jesus as the inaugurator of a new order, fulfilling the old.

**Signs of Transformation and Fulfillment:**

The miracle itself, turning water into wine, is the first of seven key signs in John's Gospel. The six jars, representing the old ways or the six days of creation, are filled by human effort but transformed by Christ into the superior new wine, signifying His completion and elevation of all things. These signs, culminating in Lazarus's raising and His own resurrection, declare Jesus as the new creation, the new Temple, the Lord of the true Sabbath.

**Christ, the Divine Bridegroom:**

A central revelation at Cana is Jesus' identity as the Divine Bridegroom. This ancient metaphor, rooted in the Old Testament portrayal of God's covenant with Israel, finds its ultimate reality in Christ. John the Baptist knew Him as such, and Jesus Himself spoke of the Bridegroom's presence. Through His sacrifice, Jesus establishes a New Covenant, wedding Himself to His people, the Church, in a relationship of intimate love and joy, just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.

**Mary's Timeless Counsel:** Amidst the need, Mary offers her final recorded words in Scripture: "Do whatever he tells you." This simple instruction remains the surest path to experiencing Christ's transformative power and grace in our lives.

**Finding Fulfillment in Him:** For those experiencing weakness, loneliness, or a sense of lack in hope, love, or intimacy, the mystery of the Divine Bridegroom offers solace. He is presented as the one who fulfills all longings, the Beloved Son, the Messiah, the Lamb, the Creator, inviting us into a renewed relationship that transforms our emptiness into abundance, much like water became the finest wine. This invitation calls for turning to Him in prayer, seeking that intimate connection He offers.
