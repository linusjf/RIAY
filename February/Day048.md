### AI-Generated Summary: Mary Our Queen and Intercessor

Here is a brief consideration of a spiritual practice centred on prayer and quiet contemplation, which, like a key turning in a lock, opens a door to a deeper acquaintance with Our Lord Jesus and His Mother Mary. This practice is held to be a conduit of that divine bounty we call grace, flowing out into the world.

The heart of this reflection turns upon Mary's high station as Queen of Heaven and Earth. We look to that strange and glorious book, Revelation, specifically chapter twelve, verses one through five. There we see a wondrous sign: a Woman in the heavens, arrayed with the sun, the moon beneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars upon her head. She is about to bear a child, and a great dragon waits to devour him. The child, a male, is born and swiftly taken up to God's throne. It is worth noting Revelation 11:19 just before this, which speaks of God's temple in heaven being opened and the Ark of His Covenant being seen. This places the Ark and the temple in heaven alongside the sign of the Woman.

This Woman, though sometimes seen as the Church, is here chiefly considered as Mary. Her being crowned Queen is understood as a natural consequence of her motherhood to Jesus, who is the eternal King, the new David. As Revelation and Luke 1:32 attest, she is the one who brought forth the male child destined to rule all nations. In the ancient kingdoms, the mother of the king held a unique and powerful position: the Queen Mother. Psalm 45 speaks of the queen standing at the king's right hand. This is seen as Mary sharing in Jesus' authority at God's throne, symbolised by her crown of stars. This royal position means she is due a particular kind of honour and respect, which, rightly understood, does not in the least diminish the adoration due to Christ alone.

Indeed, the wise St. John Damascene, writing long ago, observed that no mind, be it human or angelic, could adequately praise Mary, through whom we perceive God's glory. He called her Queen Mother, benefactress, God's mother, and queen over all creation.

From this perspective, Mary is indeed worthy of veneration – the highest given to a creature, called _hyperdulia_ – distinct entirely from the _latria_, the adoration reserved for God alone. Honouring her is, in truth, a way of honouring her Son.

Her role as Queen Mother continues as she intercedes for us, sharing in her Son's authority and pouring out grace. Her Queenship is seen as the glorification of her motherhood, fruitful and effective for those who turn to her. We are encouraged to honour her and place our confidence in her as a great intercessor and advocate in heaven.

Such a practice often includes familiar prayers, like the Hail Mary, parts of the Our Father ("and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil amen"), the Glory Be, and the conclusion of the Sign of the Cross ("in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit amen"). It concludes with a simple message of gratitude for praying together and a hope to continue the journey, followed by a blessing.
