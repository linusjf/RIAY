Luminous Mysteries
3.The proclamation of the kingdom - The Kingdom and the Gospel. Mark 1:14-15.

The Greek word euangèlion means to preach. Jesus not only preaches the word of God but also brought it to fruition through miracles. He proclaims the sovereignty of God, the good news.

### AI-Generated Summary: On the King's Proclamation and His Reign

My dear reader, let us consider for a moment the heart of the matter, which is often obscured by our hurried modern thoughts. When we turn to prayer and quiet contemplation, perhaps dwelling upon the mysteries of Our Lord's life, we are not merely performing a duty or seeking a fleeting comfort. No, we are opening a channel, as it were, for grace to flow, deepening that vital connection with Jesus and His Blessed Mother.

Consider that pivotal moment when Jesus stepped forth, as told in the Gospel of Mark (1:14-15), proclaiming that "the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." Here lie two words of immense weight, often passed over too lightly: "Gospel" and "Kingdom."

Mark this:

- **"Gospel,"** or _Evangelion_ in the Greek, was no mere piece of interesting news. In that ancient world, it was the term for a royal announcement of victory or the birth of an emperor – a message that _changed_ things simply by being declared. It was performative, not just informative. When the early Christians used this word for Jesus's message, they were saying, "Here is the true King's saving decree, a message that _does_ something, that brings about the very salvation it speaks of through His deeds and words."
- **"Kingdom of God"** is likewise misunderstood if we think only of a place or a government. The Greek word speaks less of a territory and more of a _reign_, the active _lordship_ of the King. Think of it less as a noun and more as a verb: God _reigning_.

Jesus's proclamation, then, is not just a prediction of a future state, but the announcement that God's active, saving reign is breaking into the world _now_, through Him. His miracles, His teachings, His very presence – these are not illustrations of the Kingdom; they are the Kingdom in action, God Himself actively ruling, shepherding, and saving. The glorious news is precisely this: God is not distant or idle. He is here, He is active, He is King. We are not left to save ourselves by our own frantic efforts. His reign is at hand, accessible through Christ, by the Spirit. To sit with this truth in prayer is to find a deep and abiding peace.
