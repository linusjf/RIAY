5\. The finding of Lord Jesus in the temple - Luke 2:41-52
Jesus, along with his parents, makes the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the feast of the passover. Though it was obligatory for Jewish boys to make the pilgrimage at the age of 13, Jesus accompanies his father Joseph at the age of 12 in preparation for the following year. Mary is faithful in accompanying her spouse and son. This teaches us that our life on earth is a pilgrimage, we are all walking in faith towards being more holy.
Jesus was lost and found in 3 days, which was an indication of Mary losing him at Mt. Calvary and getting him back in 3 days.
Jesus stays back at the temple to fulfil filial obedience. With the same obedience he surrendered himself on the cross, so we could share inner oneness with God.

### AI-Generated Summary: In His Father's House

Here is a glimpse into that singular moment when the Boy Jesus, at the threshold of His youth, revealed something profound about His nature and mission.

- Each year, the devout journeyed to Jerusalem for the great feasts, a pilgrimage woven into the very fabric of their lives. When Jesus was twelve, He went with His parents to the Passover, as was the custom, even for those not yet bound by all the Law's strictures.
- On the return journey, amidst the bustling company of fellow travellers, His parents discovered Him missing. Imagine their dread! Three days they sought Him â€“ a day's journey out, a day back, and a day searching in the great city.
- At last, they found Him, not lost or frightened, but in the Temple courts, seated among the learned teachers. He was not merely listening, but asking questions and offering answers that left all who heard Him utterly astonished by His understanding.
- His mother, Mary, finding Him thus, voiced the natural anxiety of any parent: "Son, why have You treated us so? Your father and I have sought You anxiously."
- His reply, though simple, struck at the heart of who He was: "Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?" Or, as some render it, "in My Father's house." This was no childish defiance, but the quiet assertion of a deeper, divine calling, a foreshadowing of His life's work and His ultimate return to that very 'house'.
- Though His parents did not fully grasp His words then, He went back with them to Nazareth, obedient to their earthly authority. Mary, like a faithful pilgrim herself, treasured these mysterious events in her heart, pondering their meaning.
- And so, the Boy grew, increasing not only in stature but in wisdom and in favour with both God and man. This episode underscores that His obedience to God was the very source of His freedom, a pattern for us who are called to be God's sons and daughters. It reminds us that our own lives are a pilgrimage, wherein we, too, are invited to dwell, in spirit and truth, in our Heavenly Father's house, finding joy and true liberty in His will.
