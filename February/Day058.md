### AI-Generated Summary: The Ingenuity of Divine Love

Let us consider the matter of prayer, that quiet turning of the soul toward the Divine, by which we may draw nearer to Him and His Mother, finding therein a fount of grace.

- Our thoughts alight upon that wondrous moment, the Last Supper, when Our Lord instituted the Eucharist, giving Himself in the form of bread and wine.
- It is asked how one might maintain this converse in the clamour of the world, so unlike the stillness of solitude. The answer lies in what one might call the creativity of love. Just as earthly affection finds means, however humble or inconvenient, to be near the beloved, so too must our love for Christ inspire us to carve out time for Him amidst life's press. For our own poor ingenuity in love is but an echo, a faint response, to His boundless, inventing Love.
- This divine creativity is nowhere more evident than in His astonishing condescension, taking the form of mere bread and wine. So humble, so utterly accessible, that He might find His way to those He loves, be it in gilded chapel or grimy cell. Through this means, His Presence has been able to pierce the darkness of prisons, the squalor of slums, even the horror of camps, demonstrating that profound ingenuity of love by being present in accessible ways.
- For God does not offer us clever answers to suffering's riddle. No, His response is His very Presence beside us, and the long, bright history of His goodness, which brings light. We hear tales of His Kingdom breaking through, palpable and real, even at the very edge of life, when He comes in that humble form.
- To ponder the sheer beauty, the breathtaking humility of this Presence, Emmanuel, God With Us, especially in the Blessed Sacrament, is a profound invitation. Are we, then, making our reply? Are we seeking Him out in that quiet place, cultivating devotion, recognising the sheer gift of God remaining present, humble, accessible, and good?
