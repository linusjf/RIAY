### AI-Generated Summary: The First Sign and Mary's Unfolding Role

To draw nearer to the King and His Mother through prayer and quiet thought is, as it were, to open channels of grace for the world. Let us cast our minds back to a certain wedding feast in Cana of Galilee, as recounted by the Evangelist John. Here, in the midst of earthly celebration, a divine pattern began to unfold.

Consider the scene:

- The wine, that symbol of mirth and fellowship, runs dry. A small crisis, perhaps, but one upon which a greater drama turns.
- Mary, His Mother, ever watchful, perceives the lack and simply states the fact to her Son.
- His reply seems, at first blush, a gentle demurral, hinting that His appointed hour had not yet struck.
- Yet, Mary, with a quiet confidence born of years of pondering the mysteries she held in her heart, instructs the servants with profound simplicity: "Do whatever he tells you."

This moment reveals much. After the finding in the Temple, where the twelve-year-old Jesus spoke of His Father's business, Mary did not grasp all, but she kept these things, turning them over in her soul. In the silent years that followed, her understanding, rooted in perfect faith, deepened. By Cana, her receptivity had flowered into initiative. She knew, though perhaps not fully the 'how' or 'when', something of His power and purpose.

And so, at her quiet word, the water was transformed into wine, and not merely wine, but the best, saved surprisingly for the last. This was His first public 'sign', a glimpse of His glory, confirming the faith of those who followed Him.

For Mary, this was also a moment of profound significance. It marked the beginning of His public work, the necessary loosening of earthly ties as He turned toward His ultimate mission. It was a sacrifice, a giving over of her Son to the world He came to redeem, mirroring His own free offering of Himself.

Mary stands before us as the perfect disciple â€“ faithful, obedient, growing in wisdom through prayer, and ultimately, giving back the greatest Gift she had received. Let us look to her, ponder her example, and seek the grace to imitate her generosity, freely giving of the gifts entrusted to us, even when it costs us dear.
