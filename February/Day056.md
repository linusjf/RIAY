### AI-Generated Summary: The Kingdom Arrives

Behold, Jesus steps into Galilee, and His message rings out: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." (Mark 1:14-15). This is the heart of our contemplation.

- **The Kingdom is Himself:** Pope John Paul II wisely pointed out that this 'Kingdom' is not merely a place or a future event, but is, in truth, present in the very person of Jesus. When He declares it is "at hand," He means _He_ is here.
- **Proclamation by Word and Deed:** This is no mere announcement; it is an _arrival_. Jesus speaks of the Kingdom, yes, through parables ("The Kingdom of Heaven is like..."), teaching, and declaring His authority. But He also _brings_ it into being through His actions.
- **Actions Reveal the King:** Consider His deeds: He calls ordinary folk to follow Him. He confronts the shadows of evil, casting out demons. He touches and heals the sick – the leper, the paralytic, Peter's mother-in-law – showing power over suffering. He calls Levi, the outcast tax collector, offering a new life, demonstrating power over sin. He declares Himself the Bridegroom, the Lord of the Sabbath.
- **The Core Message:** Through all this, Jesus reveals Himself as the one humanity truly seeks – the King with power over sickness and sin, who tenderly calls sinners to Himself. The message is clear and urgent: Turn away from what separates you (repent), and trust utterly in this good news (believe).
- **Finding What the Heart Seeks:** The good news is that Jesus, the powerful and loving Lord, is near, especially to the outcast and the sinner. All that the restless heart longs for is found in Him.
- **Drawing Near:** To grasp this mystery, we are invited to quiet attention, to prayer and meditation, which deepen our relationship with Jesus and His Mother, becoming a source of grace in our own lives. The Kingdom is indeed at hand.
