### AI-Generated Summary: The Garden of Crushing and Obedience

Now, let us turn our minds to a most profound moment, the Agony in the Garden, the first of the Sorrowful Mysteries, a place where prayer and grace meet. Picture Gethsemane, a name meaning "oil press". Just as olives are crushed to yield precious oil, or grapes trodden for wine, or wheat broken for bread, so too was the Son of Man pressed in that garden.

Here, in the shadow of suffering, we see Jesus, our Lord, wrestling with a sorrow so deep it threatened death itself. St. Thomas tells us this grief surpassed all others, for it sprang from a perfect wisdom and charity, lamenting the weight of _all_ sins simultaneously. While we know sorrow, His was unique, born of His divine and human perfection.

Consider His movement through the garden: from the general company, to the chosen few (Peter, James, John), and finally, utterly alone. This mirrors, perhaps, the deepening levels of intimacy we are called to seek with Him, culminating in that solitary, sacred space of union with the Father.

In this garden, Jesus stands forth as the New Adam. The first Adam, given freedom, chose distrust and disobedience, bringing ruin. But Christ, the second Adam, used His freedom to choose perfect obedience, even unto death. His "Yes" in Gethsemane undoes Adam's fateful "No," conquering sin and death through trust in His Father's goodness. His prayer, "Not my will, but yours be done," is the very heart of this reversal.

Furthermore, He is revealed as our High Priest. Not one offering beasts upon an altar, but He who, through suffering, learned obedience and offered prayers with loud cries during His earthly life. He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him. In Gethsemane, He begins to offer the ultimate sacrifice: Himself.

This sacrifice, unlike the temporary symbols of old (like the scapegoat or Passover lamb), is an act of perfect obedience, born of absolute trust in the Father and the certainty of the resurrection. It is here, in the garden's crushing press, that Jesus brings the full anguish of human existence before God. As Pope Benedict XVI reminds us, His obedience brings life for us all.

So, when we find ourselves in our own gardens of anguish and difficulty, let us remember Gethsemane. We are invited to bring our needs and desires, our very crushing, before the Father, entrusting all to His will with confidence in His final and everlasting goodness. This journey in prayer, reflecting on these truths, is a path to deeper relationship and grace.
