### RIAY Day 38 Nadya Baracho

Luminous Mysteries
5\. The Institution of the Eucharist - Jesus tthe Bread of Life. Luke 22:14-23
Jesus institutes the new covenant at the last supper with his apostles. Just as the traditional passover revolved around the sacrifice of the lamb, the new passover revolves around the body and blood of Christ who was crucified for us. Jesus is the lamb of God who led us through the new Exodus from sin to freedom. He is the new manna which sustains us through our journey to the promised land. The bread blessed, broken and given becomes His flesh!
It is mandatory for us to eat his flesh to receive eternal life.
