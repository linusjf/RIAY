Luminous Mysteries
5\. The Institution of the Eucharist - Jesus tthe Bread of Life. Luke 22:14-23
Jesus institutes the new covenant at the last supper with his apostles. Just as the traditional passover revolved around the sacrifice of the lamb, the new passover revolves around the body and blood of Christ who was crucified for us. Jesus is the lamb of God who led us through the new Exodus from sin to freedom. He is the new manna which sustains us through our journey to the promised land. The bread blessed, broken and given becomes His flesh!
It is mandatory for us to eat his flesh to receive eternal life.

### AI-Generated Summary: The Bread of Life and the New Passover

Let us ponder the fifth Luminous Mystery, that astonishing moment when Our Lord instituted the Eucharist at the Last Supper. Here, in the upper room, the ancient story finds its glorious completion, and a new, wondrous reality is unveiled.

- We hear in Luke's Gospel how Jesus took bread and wine, declaring them His very Body and Blood, given for us, establishing a New Covenant. This act reveals Him not only as Messiah, Son, and Light, but pre-eminently as the Bread of Life and the Lamb of God.
- Behold how the ages whispered of this coming gift! From the offerings of Abel and Abraham, through Melchizedek's bread and wine, to that strange, heavenly manna that fed Israel in the wilderness (the very "food of angels"), and the sacred Bread of the Presence – all pointed towards this ultimate sustenance.
- Even in the New Testament, signs abound: Jesus born in Bethlehem, the "House of Bread," and His miraculous feeding of the multitudes. Yet, the clearest sign is His own declaration in John chapter 6: "My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink." A hard saying for some, indeed, but the very heart of life itself.
- The Last Supper occurred during the ancient Jewish Passover, that solemn feast commemorating Israel's deliverance from Egypt through the sacrifice of a lamb. Jesus, the true Lamb of God, gives this feast its definitive meaning through His own 'passing over' to the Father by death and resurrection.
- The old Passover required the sacrifice of a spotless lamb, its blood marking the doorposts, its flesh eaten as a sacred duty. This was a memorial, a looking back. The New Passover, instituted by Christ, looks back to His sacrifice, but also looks forward to the final gathering in God's Kingdom, and astonishingly, makes His sacrifice present amongst us.
- Jesus is the New Covenant, the New Exodus from sin, the New Manna sustaining us on our pilgrimage. As He plainly states in John 6, we must receive His Body and Blood to have life abiding in us, for He is the bread from heaven offering eternal life.
- Thus, the revelations of Jesus' identity – at Baptism as the Anointed, at Cana as the Bridegroom, in His ministry as the Kingdom, at the Transfiguration as Light and Fulfillment – culminate here, where He is revealed as the Lamb slain yet living, who gives Himself entirely as our spiritual food.
- The good news is this: God is with us, and Jesus, the fulfillment of all hopes and shadows, remains with us, offering Himself as true food for the journey to the Eternal Promised Land. Let us receive this gift with profound awe, adoration, and gratitude.
