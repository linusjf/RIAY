### AI-Generated Summary: Unexpected Gifts From Manger to Shelter

Let us consider a matter of profound import, woven from ancient prophecy and present reality, concerning the arrival of a King and the reception of His gifts.

- We turn first to that most familiar scene in Bethlehem, recounted in Luke chapter two. By decree of Caesar Augustus, a humble couple, Joseph and Mary, found themselves far from home. There, in a stable, amidst the beasts, the Virgin bore her Son, laying Him in a manger for want of a proper cradle. A King arrived, not in a palace, but in the lowliest of circumstances.

- To simple shepherds keeping watch by night came a sudden, blinding glory and the voice of an angel proclaiming tidings of great joy: a Saviour was born. The heavenly host appeared, praising God, and the shepherds, filled with awe and wonder, hastened to find the babe just as the angel had described. They saw, they believed, and they spread the word, while Mary quietly pondered these astonishing events in her heart. This is the heart of the third joyful mystery.

- Now, let us leap across the centuries to our own time, to a place of refuge for those without homes. On a certain Christmas night, a gathering was held, a small echo of that ancient joy, with carols sung and simple fare shared.

- Into this unexpected warmth stepped a soul named Fitz, newly released from the cold confines of prison, seeking merely a bed. He found himself bewildered by the festive scene, by the mixture of guests and hosts celebrating with surprising cheer.

- As the evening unfolded, Fitz observed, partook of the meal, and later, received gifts made possible by the kindness of others. And then, the most remarkable thing occurred: overwhelmed by this undeserved goodness, this sheer weight of unexpected generosity, he wept, confessing, "it's just too much."

- Is this not akin to the shepherds' own awe before the unbelievable glory they witnessed? Or Mary's quiet pondering of the Inexpressible Gift she held? Fitz's tears, like the shepherds' wonder, were a fitting response to encountering a goodness so profound, so undeserved, that it feels, indeed, "too much." It reminds us that the grace given in that manger is a gift beyond measure, one we are invited to receive with similar awe and gratitude. Let us ask for the grace to do so.
