### AI-Generated Summary: Seeing by True Light

Consider, if you will, the fourth Luminous Mystery: the Transfiguration. It is a moment recounted in the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 17), where Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain, away from the common bustle. There, before their very eyes, He was changed; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became dazzling white. Moses and Elijah appeared alongside Him, and from a bright cloud, the very voice of God declared Jesus His beloved Son. The disciples, overwhelmed with awe, fell to the ground, only to be gently raised by Jesus Himself.

What are we to make of this extraordinary vision? It is, perhaps, much like the first time one truly sees the stars. We live, many of us, in cities ablaze with artificial light, where the true glory of the night sky is utterly obscured. We see only the nearest, brightest points, mistaking them for the whole celestial tapestry.

- The experience of seeing the Milky Way for the first time, far from suburban glow, is one of breathtaking brilliance, yet it often requires stepping away from comfort, from the familiar lights of home.
- So too, the Transfiguration occurred on a mountain, a place set apart, demanding effort to reach and offering no ordinary comforts.

This is the key, I think. Our modern world, much like a sprawling city, generates immense 'light pollution' â€“ the ceaseless glare of entertainment, media, noise, and worldly anxieties. These distractions, both external and internal, create a kind of spiritual din that prevents us from seeing the true light, the divine brilliance of Christ and the truths of faith.

- These worldly lights, though often flashing and insistent, are ultimately artificial; they do not reveal, but conceal.
- They hinder contemplation, making it difficult to be moved by the subtle, profound beauty of God's presence.

Just as one must leave the city's glare and ascend to a higher, darker place to behold the full glory of the cosmos, we are invited, through this mystery, to step away from the world's clamour. This separation is not a rejection of life, but a necessary discipline to gain true sight. It allows us to perceive the spiritual landscape, to see God's goodness and the brilliance of His Son, often obscured by the noise below. Let us identify what causes this pollution in our own lives and ask for the grace and courage to step aside, that we might truly see.
