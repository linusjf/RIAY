### AI-Generated Summary: The Innocent Condemned and the Terrible Scourge

After the arrest in the garden, Jesus was brought before the Jewish council, the Sanhedrin. They sought a pretext for his ruin and found him guilty of blasphemy for claiming equality with God. However, being powerless to enact the final penalty themselves, they delivered him to the Roman Governor, Pilate.

- Pilate, rather puzzled, conducted his own examination. He saw no earthly threat in this King whose kingdom was not of this world and declared him innocent of any crime worthy of death by Roman standards.
- The custom of releasing a prisoner at Passover arose. The crowd, swayed by the authorities, chose Barabbas – a name meaning "son of the father" – a sad and ironic preference for an earthly son over the true Son who offers freedom from guilt through sacrifice.
- Yet, swayed by fear and the clamour of the crowd, Pilate made his cowardly choice, condemning an innocent man. As part of this dreadful sentence, he ordered Jesus to be scourged.

Roman scourging was a dreadful, tearing business, a brutal lashing with whips embedded with bone or metal, often inflicted before crucifixion to punish and weaken. This beating was so severe it left Jesus needing help to carry his cross later.

- This outward agony, terrible as it was, mirrored a deeper, invisible torment. In the garden and through his passion, Jesus took upon Himself the full, crushing weight of human wrongness, the guilt and the dreadful payment due.
- Indeed, as the old saying has it, God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us. The sinless one endured the just condemnation for sin, serving as that mysterious figure, the Suffering Servant foretold in Isaiah 53.
- This prophecy speaks of one despised, acquainted with sorrow, who bore our griefs and carried our sorrows, wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The iniquity of us all was laid upon Him, and by His suffering, healing comes.

Thus, the horrific scourging is a key moment in Jesus's passion, where the innocent Son of God bore our iniquities for our salvation.
