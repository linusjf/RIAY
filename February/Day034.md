### RIAY Luminous Mysteries - Day 34

Nadya Baracho

1. Baptism of Jesus Mathew 3:13-17

The mystery of the Holy Trinity is revealed as soon as Jesus is baptised at the Jordan. The Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, the Spirit of God, descends from heaven.
The river Jordan had a lot historic significance. It was the turning point for Joshua at the end of the Exodus. Prophet Elijah went up to heaven at the river Jordan, Prophet Elisha started his prophetic ministry at the river Jordan.

John's baptism was about beginning anew, reorienting one's life and preparing for the coming of the Messiah.
John through his baptism with water washed away sins and prepared the peoples' heart for the Messiah.
Jesus by dying on the cross, going to the tomb and resurrecting, washed away our sins to get us closer to His Father.

### AI-Generated Summary: The Baptism of Christ A Glimpse of Redemption

- Through prayer and quiet reflection, we seek a deeper connection with Our Lord and His Blessed Mother, for it is in this communion that true grace is found.
- Our contemplation today rests upon the first of the Luminous Mysteries: the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River, a scene vividly painted in Matthew's Gospel.
- Consider the moment: Jesus, the Sinless One, approaches John the Baptist, the voice crying in the wilderness. John, knowing the truth of who stands before him, initially hesitates, feeling the roles should be reversed. Yet Jesus insists, declaring it necessary "to fulfill all righteousness."
- At this juncture, the veil between heaven and earth is drawn back. The heavens open, the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, and the very voice of the Father declares, "This is my beloved Son." Here, the Trinity is revealed, and Jesus is shown forth as the Messiah, the Anointed One upon whom the Spirit rests.
- The Jordan itself is steeped in history – the crossing into the Promised Land, the deeds of prophets. Now, it becomes the stage for a new beginning, a new entry into God's kingdom.
- John's baptism was a powerful, concrete act of repentance and conversion, a symbolic washing away of the past and a step towards a new life in anticipation of the coming Messiah.
- But Jesus' baptism is different. He, having no sin of His own, enters the water _for us_. He steps into the place of sinners, taking upon Himself the burden of mankind's guilt, prefiguring the ultimate act of identification on the Cross.
- This descent into the Jordan foreshadows His descent into death itself. He carries our sins into the tomb, as it were, only to rise again, cleansed, making our own cleansing possible. This is why He would later refer to His Passion as a "baptism."
- Echoes of ancient rituals resonate here. John beholds Jesus and cries, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" – recognising Him as both the unblemished Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice saves, and the Scapegoat, upon whom the sins of the people were symbolically laid before being driven into the wilderness.
- Indeed, immediately after His baptism, the Spirit leads Jesus into the wilderness, just as the scapegoat was led out. He is the true Lamb, offered for us, His sacrifice made present in the Mass.
- Thus, in the Baptism at the Jordan, we see the beloved Son, empowered by the Spirit, freely embracing the weight of our sinfulness. Heaven affirms His identity, and He begins the work of salvation by taking our place, opening for us the path to purification and new life through His own self-offering.
