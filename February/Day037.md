### AI-Generated Summary: The Mountain of Light

Imagine, if you will, a high place, a mountain lifting three chosen souls—Peter, James, and John—above the common earth. There, before their astonished eyes, the veil between worlds thinned, and their Master, Jesus, stood revealed not merely as man, but blazing with an inward light, His face shining like the sun, His raiment dazzling white. Beside Him appeared two mighty figures from the old story: Moses, the Law-giver from Sinai, and Elijah, the Prophet from Carmel.

- This was no mere vision, but a glimpse into the very heart of Reality. It was the great Summing Up, where the Law and the Prophets, who had pointed towards Him across the ages, now stood beside Him in whom all their prophecies found their 'Yes'.
- Then, from a bright cloud, the very Voice of the Father declared, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him." A command echoing not just across that mountaintop, but down through history to each one of us.
- To "listen to Him" is far more than mere obedience; it is an invitation to enter into that unimaginable, eternal dance of love and delight that exists between the Father and the Son—the very substance of God's life, and our ultimate destiny.
- Jesus is revealed as the Lord of Glory, fulfilling the roles of Moses (giving the new Law through the Spirit) and Elijah (leading a new Exodus from slavery through His blood). The old guides fade; only He remains, for He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
- This mountain moment points beyond the necessary path through the Shadow-Lands of the Cross, towards the true Country: a sharing in His glory and an intimate relationship with the Father.
- Our journey is one of listening to Him, walking with Him, being transformed into His likeness, pressing on towards that ultimate fulfillment and joy.

For this arduous yet glorious path, we must ever seek the Holy Spirit's courage, hope, and strength.
