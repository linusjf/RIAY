### AI-Generated Summary: The Burden and the Scapegoat

Consider the fourth Sorrowful Mystery, the journey to Golgotha. It was the custom to lead the condemned outside the city walls, a public spectacle of shame at the crossroads where all might see. And so they marched Jesus out, burdened with the instrument of His own death.

Yet, the text reminds us, He was too weakened by the preceding horrors to bear it alone. Here steps in Simon of Cyrene, likely a visitor for the Passover, compelled by the brutal efficiency of Roman law to share the load. Imagine his initial reluctance, perhaps annoyance, giving way to a shared experience with the very Lord of the universe.

But there is a deeper, more profound paradox at play, illuminated by the ancient rituals of Israel. The Jewish law spoke of clean and unclean. Here is Christ, the very fount of Purity, yet He is condemned and cast out as utterly unclean. He is driven forth from the city, just as the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement was led into the wilderness, bearing the iniquity of the people.

- Jesus is presented as the true Scapegoat, fulfilling the ancient shadow.
- His bearing of sin is not for any transgression of His own, but because the Father, in a mystery beyond our full comprehension, laid the iniquities of us all upon Him.
- He, the Clean, is treated as the Unclean, cast out from the community He came to save.
- This exile mirrors the fate of the ritual scapegoat, sent forth into the desolate place.

Reflect on this sorrowful truth: the Creator, the Lord, the Light of the World, rejected by His own creation, sent into exile, bearing the crushing weight of our rebellion, marched out to die as the ultimate sacrifice, the true Scapegoat for the sins of the world. It is a moment for sorrow, yes, but also for awe at the depth of such love and sacrifice.
